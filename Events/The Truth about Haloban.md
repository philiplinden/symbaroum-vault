[[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden|Wrath of the Warden]], p.41-42

It was the barbarians who first started telling stories about the [[Beast Clan]]—blight marked, raving warriors that attacked humans and goblins in southern [[Davokar]] and that did not carry any defining characteristics of the established clans. And soon the first Ambrian witnesses emerged. Ten dead in a logging camp were blamed on the [[Beast Clan]]; then a butchered farmer’s family and a burnt down croft. The speculations ran wild. Could it be disguised Ambrian patriots out to defame barbarians in general? Or was it [[Karohar Clan|Karits]] who masked themselves hoping to scare the Ambrians away?

In fact, the Sun Priests of [[Thistle Hold]] have heard the truth about the [[Beast Clan]], spoken by one of their prisoners – the gravely stigmatized hunter [[Malrek]] who remains in a cell deep beneath the temple: when the Ambrians attacked the [[Jezora Clan|Jezites]] in #year10, a large part of the clan members fled down into the natural caves below the fortress, and the camouflaged passage down was never found by [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]]’s troops. The remaining [[Jezora Clan|Jezites]] have lived down there ever since, continuously affected by the nurturing but also corrupting power of the black bedrock. Natural cavities in the [[Underworld]] have also given them access to the surface, by way of gorges and small sinkholes inside [[Davokar]].

[[Malrek]] was captured and told his tale #year18. The hunter’s testimony was regarded as improbable but so worrying that it must be examined. A group of [[Twilight Friars|Black Cloaks]] followed [[Malrek]]’s directions, but even if they found several passages down into the Abyss they located no tunnels leading beneath the town. During the winter of #year19, [[Lasifor Nightpitch]] and the [[Queen's Legation|Queen’s Legation]] was informed and it was decided that the search must continue, now supported by the [[Queen's Rangers|Queen’s Rangers]] and scouts from clan [[Odaiova Clan]]. But six months ago the hunt was called off since natural caves below [[Thistle Hold]] had been found, though without any traces of living beings. The caves were never fully mapped; sensitive senses warned about the thoroughly corrupt and corrupting nature of the deep.
