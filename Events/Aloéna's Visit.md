[[@Throne3.YndarosDarkestStar|The Darkest Star]], p.15
> Until the summer of year 20, the people of [[Yndaros]] felt distanced and relatively safe from the elven menace; it was something that mainly concerned the realm’s northern provinces. But then, one sunny summer day, [[Aloéna]] arrived in the city. They say that she walked across the surging surface of the river, near Fortress Doudram, without even getting her feet wet, and made her way through the streets and alleys until reaching Envoy [[Elori]]’s residence down the hill from the palace. The news of a creature of [[Davokar]] moving through the city spread like wildfire; its presence sparked fear in the populace, but none could resist the urge to catch a glimpse of the she-giant as she continued unfazed and unhindered through the crowds, who immediately parted before her and closed behind her.

> No one knows what was said between [[Aloéna]] and [[Elori]], but as the fascination (or “enchantment”, as some called it) waned, the suspicion began to grow. The predominant view is that [[Aloéna]] is the dark queen of [[Davokar]], that [[Elori]] is one of her captains, and that their meeting concerned some sort of scheme against humanity—an attack on [[Yndaros]], perhaps, or even full-scale war.
