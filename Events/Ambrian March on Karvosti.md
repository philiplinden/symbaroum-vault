rough schedule below, in which [[Crueljaw]]’s outburst at the Longhouse counts as day 0. Should the player characters be on the move, they could of course be brought up to speed upon returning to the cliff. 

## Day 1: Something is about to happen! 
Two merchants arrive from [[Thistle Hold]], claiming to have spotted soldiers on the fields west of the city. They were raising tents and Brother Bartho as a NPC If the Gamemaster so wishes, Brother Bartho could offer (or even demand) to accompany the characters on their journey, which may be particularly appropriate if the gaming group is a small one, or the characters lack some of his abilities. In that case, we suggest that Bartho is played by the Gamemaster, but that one of the players takes over during combat and other situations that require die rolls. An interesting alternative would be to let Bartho use the characters for gathering clues, and later betray them in the beginning of Act III. For example, he could contact his good friend Cleaver, who would settle for a considerably smaller part of the treasure, or collaborate with the [[Queen's Rangers|Queen’s Rangers]] in exchange for a small fortune pavilions; a handful of large tents were already in place when the witnesses passed the area. 

## Day 2: A group of pilgrims brings news of military activity in Narugor
They travelled by boat from Kurun towards the Arch Bridge, and as they were leaving port, they noticed that several barges had arrived during the night. The ships had come from the south, carrying equipment and soldiers – most likely archers from Agrella.
## Day 3: Several newcomers can tell of a military encampment having been established west of [[Thistle Hold]]
They say that there were roughly five hundred men, with more on the way. The purpose of the army remains unclear, but there is much speculation on the subject. Some think that [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]] and her uncle, Duke Alesaro of New Berendoria, have finally had enough of each other. But most believe that the army is headed elsewhere: to [[Karvosti]]. The army outside [[Thistle Hold]] continues to grow. Most recent to arrive was a cavalry unit of roughly one hundred soldiers from Seragon. The total number of soldiers must be close to five thousand. When the Characters Have Visited Their Second Adventure Location in Act II: A hot rumor begins to circulate the plateau, even though no one really knows who first brought the news. The army outside [[Thistle Hold]] is now more than seven thousand strong, and a column of more than two hundred Pansars is apparently marching north from [[Yndaros]]. What is more, at the head of the column rides [[Queen Korinthia]] herself!
