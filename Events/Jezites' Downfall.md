[[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden|Wrath of the Warden]], p.12

Everyone knows that Ambrian forces utterly defeated the barbarian warlord [[Haloban]] and his clan after a short siege in year 10. It is also commonly known that the Ambrian force captured [[Haloban]] alive and brought him back to [[Yndaros]] where he hung by the neck until dead; and that the Ambrian assault totally annihilated clan [[Jezora Clan]]. Aside from that, there are some discrepancies in the stories.

Most people believe that [[Queen Korinthia]] had managed to persuade some members of the clan to betray their master by sabotaging the gates of the fortress, but other stories attribute the sabotage to the heroic actions of a group of [[Queen's Rangers|Queen’s Rangers]]. And regarding the clan’s destruction, several diverse stories are told. Some say that also women and children died fighting, others that most [[Jezora Clan|Jezites]] went up in flames with the hall where they were hiding, and there are even those who maintain that the clan members died in a mass suicide.

No matter what one believes, the annihilation of the [[Jezora Clan|Jezites]] meant the end of the barbarian presence on the southern plains. [[Haloban]]’s fortress was demolished so that no one would try to recapture it, and after that the area surrounding the ancient bronze well lay desolate for over two years, until [[Lasifor Nightpitch]] initiated his grandiose construction project.
