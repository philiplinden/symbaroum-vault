In the events leading up to [[Halaran's Cataclysm]], the two neighboring factions pursued undeath as a means to support the war between them.

Halaran invested in *creation of life* through undeath. This was conducted through [[Lafarda's Tower]].

The opposing faction invested in *preservation of life* through undeath. This was accomplished by magics recorded in tomes that would later become included in [[Codex Ambreagosa]].

After [[Halaran's Cataclysm]], [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos]] recovered the [[Codex Ambreagosa]] and used it to annihilate his enemies and amass an undead army to defend his palace.

[[Aroaleta]] and an early evolution of the [[Iron Pact]] called upon [[Eox]] to contain [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]] within the [[Blooming Vale]].
- The dense foliage surrounding the [[Blooming Vale]] is toxic to undead.
- [[Aroaleta]] brought the book back to [[Lafarda's Tower]] for safe keeping.
