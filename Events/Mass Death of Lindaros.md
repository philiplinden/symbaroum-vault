[[@Throne3.YndarosDarkestStar|The Darkest Star]], p.13

Archivists from [[Ordo Magica]] speculate that the reason for such rapid collapse of the city-state and (apparently) total decline of the population was due to an epidemic of a mysterious *bleeding disease*. The clergy holds that [[Lindaros|Lindarians]] were punished by [[Prios]] for living in arrogance and slothfulness, and thus purged from the land.

Most of today’s scholars link the epidemic to the decadent lifestyle, but there are those who disagree. The most widespread interpretation is that the [[Lindaros|Lindarians]]’ downfall was their punishment for worshipping false gods. While they did cultivate [[Prios]]’ gifts, they did so by “*planting crops in blackened soil, growing them in darkness, watering them from the spring of the Eternal Night.*”

It is said that [[Ordo Magica]] has a completely different view on the matter, and according to some of the [[Prios|Sun God]]’s most zealous servants, the Queen shares the Order’s belief that the [[Lindaros|Lindarians]] merely went a step too far; that they became arrogant and careless. This, in the church’s eyes heretical, stance scares a lot of people senseless – not just due to the prospect of another epidemic, but because the revival of old [[Lindaros|Lindarian]] practices could mean the finishing blow to the already battered, dying [[Prios|Lawgiver]].
