[[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden|Wrath of the Warden]], p.12
> During the late fall of year 13, while [[Thistle Hold]] was still under construction, an attack was launched from the forest. A force made up of at least a hundred elves (some say five hundred) struck just before dawn. Four rounds of fire arrows painted red stripes across the night sky and were followed by a fearless melee assault on the war veterans hired to defend the construction site.
> 
> The leader of the elves, later identified as the autumn elf Eloan-Eo, fell to the sword wielded by [[Serex Attio]] – several witnesses claim that the elf was beheaded from behind as he was running for the newly built toad statue. The bloodbath ended in Ambrian victory, but many humans were killed and large parts of the town’s northern districts went up in flames.
>
> In the following years the elves made numerous attempts to demolish the Hold, through outright attacks or by sneaky acts of sabotage, most recently during the winter of year 20 when two murderous elves were caught in an attic near [[Nighthome]]. But none of the later incidents have caused such great losses in lives and property as the attack of Eloan-Eo.
