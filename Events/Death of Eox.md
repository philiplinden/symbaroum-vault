[[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden|Wrath of the Warden]]

> As [[Eox]] was beheaded [[Teara-Téana]] was involved in an argument with the increasingly erratic elf prince [[Eneáno]]. And when she later that day went to seek comfort and rest in [[Eox]]’s presence, she found him butchered. With tears running in a vain attempt to cool her flaming hot cheeks, she spoke to the ashes in the coal bed of the dying creature. The impressions told her where the skull had been taken and the sound of [[Eox]]’s heart said that it must be recovered before long, if the proud ox was to have any chance to survive.
>
> Her previous contact in the Hold, the tutor [[Master Vernam]], was dead and her new agent, [[Anadea]], was untested in critical situations. But as time was short she had no alternatives, especially since the news of [[Eox]]'s mutilation could make the more aggressive members of the [[Iron Pact]] do something really foolish and dangerous – as for instance staging an attack on the walled town of [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]].

> She activated the agent [[Anadea]] and tasked her with assembling a group of trustworthy and capable individuals. The idea was that she and these people would track down and somehow manage to return with the skull of [[Eox]]. The overzealous human did what she was told, but in her eagerness to prove herself qualified she made a grave and fatal error: she took the initiative and went alone to have a look at some of the places where she knew cultists might be hiding.

> The aggressive branch of the [[Iron Pact]] which is led by the former treasure hunter [[Lysindra Goldengrasp]] has no idea about what has happened to [[Eox]] or that the skull is hidden inside the palisade. However, the autumn elf [[Mearoel]] knows the truth about the “well”, so right from the start the group will be on the hunt for the source of corruption that the device warned of – though without any success, since the skull is concealed with mystical veils.
