[[Throne of Thorns 3 - Darkest Star]], page 25

Ever since [[Queen Korinthia]]’s decree to establish a guild system was enacted in year 19, all craftsmen in [[Yndaros]] have worked within a strict hierarchy.

Each guild has its Grand Master, elected by and from a variable number of Masters, who in turn may promote diligent Novices to Adepts. The Grand Master of every guild – from masons and molders, to blacksmiths and brewers, to tailors, potters and so on – can be found in the capital, while most Masters reside in other towns and villages. After a turbulent beginning, the system is finally starting to work as intended.

However, things are being complicated by a phenomenon best exemplified within the Blacksmiths’ Guild: additional masters arriving from other regions. For the last four years Ambrian smiths have had to compete with Master [[Master Alinard|Alinard]], who came to [[Yndaros]] from the city state of Koral. Additionally, many nobles order their fencing swords from the barbarian blacksmith Master Ranomar of clan Vajvod. The Blacksmiths' Guild’s Grand Master, Petrona Steelwife, has not yet found a lawful way of prohibiting either [[Master Alinard|Alinard]] or Ranomar from using the title of Master; nor has the guild been able to prove that these “outsiders” are spying on behalf of their respective motherlands.

Despite the ongoing smear campaigns (both literal and figurative), it appears that common folk have little interest in [[Master Alinard]]’s place of birth or Ranomar’s barbarian ancestry – they craft first-rate products at relatively low prices, and the week of extra waiting caused by overbooking is something most people can accept. The question is how long Petrona and the Ambrian blacksmiths will put up with the unwanted competition.
