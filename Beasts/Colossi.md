> Among Ambrians as well as most barbarian clans, the legendary mounts of the witches are called Colossi. These massive carnivores that look like a blend of wood and flesh, instill fear and respect in any and all, but maybe these feelings would be even stronger if those meeting them knew their true origin. In truth, the colossi are not beasts like all others. They are created.

> The mystical ceremony used by the witches in this context is a well-preserved secret, only known by the most experienced among them â€“ the Huldra, the Keepers of the clans and their equals. When speaking to outsiders, the initiates claim that the colossi came with the [[Iron Pact]] from the west, which is supposedly why they use the Elven word for the creatures, *eliend*, as often as they say coloss.
