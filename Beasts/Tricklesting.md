Spider creatures that hunt in packs. 

According to some witches, Tricklestings possess a primitive consciousness. They can communicate with each other in a fully developed language based on whispers, hisses, and clicksâ€”akin to the complexity of whalesong.

[[Arach]] tribes are known to domesticate Tricklestings as hunting companions similar to a human-dog relationship.
