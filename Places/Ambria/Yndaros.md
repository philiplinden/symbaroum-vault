# History of Yndaros
## Earlier than Year 0
Yndaros today is built on the well-preserved ruins of the city-state [[Lindaros]].

## Year 0 
- The ruined walls and towers of [[Lindaros]] caught the attention of early migrants seeking refuge from [[The Great War]].
	- Ambrians laid siege to Kadizar and the clan quickly surrendered.
	- The chieftain of Kadizar submitted to the Ambrians and was granted a parcel of land to govern as Baron in return.
	- The chieftain's oldest daughter refused to submit. She eloped to the mountains along with 200 Kadizans.
	- The rest of the clan stayed and were put to work (as prisoners of war) transforming the city into a palace fit for [[Queen Korinthia]].

> Few ever speak of the seven years that passed before [[Queen Korinthia]] arrived at her new [[Ambria|promised land]]. Everyone knows it was a dark time – a time of poverty, danger and endless exhaustion; a time of slavers; a time of death. The suffering was of course necessary, inevitable even, and the blame for the misery lies entirely on the moldering shoulders of the [[Dark Lords]]. But the Queen’s people prefer to remember the victories and triumphs, rather than the necessary evil that occurred in between.

## Year 7
- Following the dramatic end to [[The Great War]], [[Queen Korinthia]] finally took residence at the palace in Yndaros.
	- It was a beautiful late summer day when [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]] and her entourage passed the posting at [[Prios Pass]]. After a three-day journey across the rolling gold of the plains, they finally halted their horses just south of today’s Temple District. Before riding on to receive the people’s ovations, the Queen raised her voice and proclaimed: “You, fair new home and fortress, shall carry the name of the true hero; your name shall be Yndaros!”

## Year 8
- The Cathedral of Martyrs is inaugurated.

## Year 19
- [[All Crafters Must Organize into Guilds]]

## Year 20
- [[Aloéna's Visit]]

## Year 21
Present day.

# Culture
## Hostility toward elves
Elves live dangerously in Yndaros. Not that many of its citizens have personally experienced the cruelty and evil attributed to the elves, but virtually everyone agrees that the “pointy-ears” consider humanity their mortal enemy. Sure, some elves present themselves as peaceful, diplomatically inclined individuals, but the overwhelming majority of people believe they can see through that charade – the elves are no more than spies intent on sabotaging the city and gathering information!

Naturally, no one dares lay a hand on [[Elori]] and his aides, as he is clearly on good terms with the [[Queen Korinthia|Queen of Ambria]]. But other elves (and changelings who in the haze of intoxication are mistaken for elves) have since become a greater target for [[Yndaros|Yndarian]] suspicion, loathing and aggression. The expression “a dead elf is a good elf” can be heard in public spaces throughout the city.

## Religious beliefs
%% [[Throne of Thorns 3 - Darkest Star]], page 29 %%
In Yndaros, [[Prios]] is ever present. His spirit watches over family dinners, court proceedings, business transactions, solemn ceremonies, births and deaths, and the people must all praise *“[[Prios]], the One”* in good times and in bad. The city’s residents still live as much in the shadow of war as they do in the radiance of triumph, and none are allowed to forget who brought victory to the Ambrians during [[The Great War]]. Guilt, gratitude and duty are recurring themes, preached by the First Theurg as well as his eminent liturgs – the Ambrian people have a long way to go before [[Prios]] has regained his strength; darkness must be vanquished, the wilds must be cleansed, and the gifts of the One must be harvested and cultivated. And these themes are undoubtedly being given a more prominent role with each passing year.
