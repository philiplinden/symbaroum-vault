A makeshift plaza with food vendors, craftspeople, and most of the few permanent structures in the area.

The Bailiff of [[Blackmoor]] and Baron Grafoldo’s eldest son, [[Keroldo Erebus]], resides in The Keep (4).

The wooden buildings accommodate, for instance, Kodomar’s
Huckery which stands wall to wall with the newly
opened guesthouse The Haymow. The leather worker [[Ansel]]
has his shop a stone toss away, next to the smithy of the war-crippled
blacksmith [[Herdol “Partly”]] so called because he has
lost one leg, an eye, and most of his left ear. Adding to these
are an assembly of smaller sheds – for example one where
used exploration equipment is traded, one where the farmers
in the area sell wares which are not good enough for the
Hold’s residents, and one where the crone [[Nodla]] peddles her
pies; pies that are difficult to chew since the dough is mixed
with bark, and that seldom taste of what you have ordered.

The Blood Robes always have six ruffians posted by the Black Square and that these are often seen throwing both taunts and spoiled foodstuffs at the missionary sun priests who move among the houses – the latter being disciples of [[Sarvola Bargomol|Father Sarvola]], branded as heretics by the First Father and all true believers in [[Prios]].

Not far from the Black Square is [[Sarvola's Mission House]].
