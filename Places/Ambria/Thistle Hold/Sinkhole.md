Aside from a few rock slides, there is absolute silence from the sinkhole. However, when the anxiety has started to fade and tired smiles can be seen on the defenders’ lips, a sudden and worrying sound is heard from the sinkhole – a rustling, shuffling sound, as if a giant serpent was moving about down in the dark. The sound grows stronger; everyone grows tense. Then the sound diminishes again, as if its source has moved on, away from the sinkhole, deeper down into the Abyss ([[Underworld]]).

### Approaching the Sinkhole
All who approach the sinkhole without having a proper permit (that is, a signed document where the town authorities state that the person may do so) will be forever banned from the town of [[Thistle Hold]]. This is the case until [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] decides differently, whenever that may be.

### Caverns at the bottom
The sinkhole is 208 ft deep from the surface to the cavern floor.
