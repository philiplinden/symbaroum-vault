East of Old Kadizar’s bailey are the docks that nowadays are used for shipping cargo to and from Ravenia in the north, Agrella in the west and Mergile in the east. South of the dockyard’s warehouses lies the most shabby laborer’s quarter in [[Yndaros]], not much more than an unstructured gathering of sheds and hovels. All buildings from the time of [[Lindaros]] are gone – officially razed to be salvaged for materials needed when reconstructing the Palace District; according to rumors demolished because the authorities did not want refugees and peasants living in easily defended stone buildings. If you trail the bailey around to the south, you will find finer living quarters for laborers and simple folk. These quarters have been allowed to keep their stone structures and they grow increasingly pleasant the closer you get to the city center.
