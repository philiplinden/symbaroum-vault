# Timeline
## Long ago
### A thriving city-state
Lindaros was a city state contemporary to old kingdoms in [[Alberetor]], but contact or trade was never developed due to the [[Titan Mountains]] that laid between them.

## Year -200
### Lindaros falls
Archivists from [[Ordo Magica]] speculate that the reason for such rapid collapse of the city-state and (apparently) total decline of the population was due to an epidemic of a mysterious *bleeding disease*. The clergy holds that Lindarians were punished by [[Prios]] for living in arrogance and slothfulness, and thus purged from the land.

## Kadizar is settled among the ruins
+ The ruins of Lindaros were largely abandoned out of superstition for centuries, except for a barbarian clan who established a small village within its walls, called Kadizar.

## Year 0
### Ambrian siege
The ruined walls and towers of [[Lindaros]] caught the attention of early migrants seeking refuge from [[The Great War]]. Ambrians laid siege to Kadizar with superior weapons and poor Kadizan defenses.

### Kadizar falls
The chieftain of Kadizar submitted to the Ambrians and was granted a parcel of land to govern as Baron in return. The chieftain's oldest daughter refused to submit. She eloped to the mountains along with 200 Kadizans.

### Ambrian occupation
The rest of the clan stayed and were put to work (as prisoners of war) transforming the city into a palace fit for [[Queen Korinthia]].

## Year 7
### Lindaros becomes *[[Yndaros]]*
[[Queen Korinthia]] declares the city to be named [[Yndaros]], and establishes it as the capitol of [[Ambria]].

# Lindarian History
Much of today’s [[Yndaros]] consists of restored and expanded structures from [[Lindaros|Lindarian]] times. This is particularly true of the city’s largest buildings: the Palace, the Cathedral of Martyrs, the Dome, the Triplet Towers, and the towers at the harbor basin. By analyzing these structures along with finds from various excavations, combined with the clans’ stories and a few surviving fragments of text, the scholars of [[Ordo Magica]] have gained what they believe is a decent understanding of who the [[Lindaros|Lindarians]] were and how they lived.

It is clear that, eventually, they all perished due to a terrible bleeding disease (*See [[Mass Death of Lindaros]])*.[^1] 

[^1]: In Year 16, there was an outbreak of the *Blood Spray Disease* in [[Thistle Hold]], killing 500-1000 humans. The origin of the disease was never found, but rumors abound. A direct connection has not been made between the *Blood Spray Disease* and the fall of Lindaros. *See: [[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden]] p. 13-14*
