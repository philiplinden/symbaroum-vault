[[Throne of Thorns 3 - Darkest Star|The Darkest Star]], p. 27
> The institution known as the Library of Anearia was founded more than two centuries ago in Berendoria, [[Alberetor]]. Its objective, which was stipulated by the original curator Anearia, is still the same as ever: to create “a comprehensive archive of everything worth knowing.” It is funded by nobles who would like to boast about their sizable donations to the library. But its main patron, and the manager of its finances, is House Karnak, currently represented by [[Sesario Karnak|Duke Sesario]] – the new husband of [[Queen Mother Abesina]] and father of Arch Duchess [[Esmerelda]].
