The Yonderworld is thought to be a mist-shrouded wasteland, possible to mistake for the [[Spirit World]], yet vastly different: its nature is corruption. Its fauna consists of abominations, from small Blight Spawns to ancient Blight Beasts of immense power. As stated by [[Katrandama]], the Yonderworld is the world from which humankind fled to this one – an idea that very few mystics are prepared to accept and the Curia has deemed to be contentious and heretical; the humans came over the eastern sea from another continent, fleeing from idol worshippers and sun haters – at least according to the official stands of the [[Sun Church]].

## Travel is faster
Every foot in the Yonderworld is 10 feet in the natural realm. This enables travel across great distances in a short amount of time, like the Nether in Minecraft.
## Corruption is everywhere

## Undeath is inverted with life
Living creatures don't feel sensations like heat, pain, or strong emotions. The effect parallels the condition that the undead experience in the natural world.
 
Undead creatures have all of their sensations from life restored, including pain from any sustained wounds.

The regular rules for healing still stand. The only active effects are for RP or at GM discretion.
# Nature
Miles-long plains of sand and dust, in rolling dunes or accumulated into towering mountains, sometimes storm-swept, sometimes turned into mud by thunderous rain – as far as anyone can see, this is all that remains. The corruption is ever present, in the dust stirred up by your footsteps and constantly radiating in the background. The Game Master can use Table 5: Corruption in the Yonderworld to get an idea of just how much corruption is present. It might also be worth consulting the table Events in the Yonderworld
in The Darkest Star (see page 75) for additional inspiration.

However, for those with enough time to further explore the wasteland, or who know what to look for, there are interesting discoveries to be made. Hidden beneath the surface are the ruins of several great civilizations that rose and fell over the millennia. Some of these might even have been exposed by rain and wind, made visible to the naked eye and available for further investigation. But one must then have the courage and strength to defy the famished inhabitants of the Yonderworld, and possess some kind of antidote for the corruption, or it will quickly turn the find of a lifetime into a nightmare.

## Creatures
There is nothing living in the Yonderworld, including its inhabitants. Sure, the daemon princes ruling the devastation are often powerful enough to rise above the pure, instinctual hunger of other abominations. Sometimes they even display something similar to rationality and cunning, but only those who were once human. Most creatures in the Yonderworld are just as furiously unreasonable as the primal blight beasts brought to life in humanity’s new homeworld.

Speaking about the new world, the daemon princes, the “exalted” humans, would like nothing more than to go there. They try to trick cultists and sorcerers into letting them do just that, but are often themselves tricked or prevented from breaking free from the rituals’ control. Humans who make it to the Yonderworld and somehow find a way back out will often do so with daemonic company (intentionally or otherwise). It is therefore not surprising that dimensional travelers quickly attract the interest of the deserts’ rulers… ^e1334b
