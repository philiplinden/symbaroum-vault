This treacherous mountain pass through the [[Titan Mountains|Titans]] was the primary migration route taken by people fleeing from [[Alberetor]] to what is now [[Ambria]] over the decade following [[The Great War]].

Prios Pass has developed into a border crossing, where refugees from [[Alberetor]] have to register before traveling further into the [[Ambria|Promised Land]].
