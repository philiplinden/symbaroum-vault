Where the rivers have pirates, the Titans have plunderers. The largest and most feared groups are the barbarian bandits of the Ice Witch and the mighty ogre Mound’s motley crew of goblins and rage trolls. The former are based in the eastern parts of the mountains, while the latter usually raid farther west. But these are by no means the only ones terrorizing travelers and caravans. Smaller bands of lowlife scum pop up every so often, ready to kill and die to get their hands on the hard-earned possessions of others. Some believe them to be outcast refugees and other unfortunate souls who have been forced into a life of crime just to survive. Such sentimental sob stories do not weaken the resolve of the rangers and the major bandit chiefs. Apparently, newly-emerged groups rarely last more than a month before they are put to the sword.

As for beasts, the mountains are heavily dominated by the Kotka – large cat creatures living in packs which sometimes head down to the plains in search of easy prey. There are plenty of Jakaars as well, sometimes accompanied by a lone hunger wolf. Wilder tales tell of giants, often called Titans, supposedly living in remote ravines or hiding underground. The scholars of [[Ordo Magica]] reject the notion of an unknown race of giants, and maintain that the observed creatures on which the stories are based were most likely liege or rage trolls. And the alleged existence of dragons and pack-living manwolves have been dismissed as equally preposterous.
