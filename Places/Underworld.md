The Underworld is a vast system of caves, chambers, tunnels
and crevasses that extends beneath the roots, fields
and cobblestones of the game world. It is a dark world in
a double sense, a world that is at most illuminated by fluorescent
vegetation or rays of sunshine beaming through
cracks from the surface, a world dominated by monstrous
predators, where the corruption of the surface world trickles
down to infect its inhabitants or form stagnant pools
of sickly blackness.
But there are also good reasons for heading down into the
dark. Some expeditions search for the sunken remains of
ancient civilizations waiting to be explored and plundered,
while others hope to find the troll realms supposedly located
there, or even the legendary dwelling of the [[Iron Pact]] – the
[[Halls of a Thousand Tears]]. Moreover, brave groups of people
occasionally set off for the Underworld in search of unique
monster trophies, missing people or expeditions, or in the
hope of gathering rare medicinal herbs.
## HISTORY
The Underworld is as old as the surface world, and its history
is just as eventful. The difference is that it is more regional
and clearly linked to events on the surface – mighty
realms, clans or tribes will rarely allow the world beneath
to develop unchecked, particularly if they feel threatened
by something down there.
The Gamemaster can therefore assume that no person,
creature or culture has ever claimed to rule or dominate
more than limited parts of the Underworld, mainly in areas
where the world above has been wild, without strong social
formations. Another assumption should be that dominance,
with few exceptions, is a temporary state; Crypt Lords, goblin
tribes or packs of predators who consider themselves
rulers of a certain area can quickly and unpleasantly be
driven away (or destroyed) by something bigger, stronger
and more brutal than themselves – a group of World Serpents,
a drifting blight mist, a rival conqueror, or maybe
even a larger expedition from the surface world, composed
of competent warriors and mystics.
## NATURE
The Underworld is so huge and diverse that it has room for
all kinds of cave structures – from labyrinthine tunnels and
smaller systems of caves, to vast underground halls the size
of Ambrian baronies. You should be equally bold when it
comes to vegetation and water courses: forests of overgrown,
luminous lichens and fields of (edible, poisonous, or corruption
oozing) fungi can extend around underground lakes
whose tributaries consist of immense waterfalls or fast-flowing
streams.
Remains from past cultures or from the civilizations of
the surface world can be found anywhere, in the form of
anything from statues to great palaces, or even entire temple
cities. One might also find caverns chiseled out by the tools
of cultural beings – dwelling sites that show signs of past
goblin settlements, or even places where exiled trolls have
stayed hidden. Many of these are still inhabited, as are the
ruins – by new rulers or predators who have claimed the
place as their territory.
Virulent corruption is everywhere, in water, in rocks, and
in treacherous vegetation – sometimes hidden, sometimes
terrifyingly obvious in the form of mist, sparkling black
flakes dancing in the air, or rust-colored
rain from a cave
roof far above. In contrast to the darkness, the fortunate
can also find power nodes, often centered around crystalline
structures of different colors, located in surprisingly
healthy areas free of corruption – places much appreciated
by predators and prey animals, but shunned by abominations
and undead.
In short, you are free to design the Underworld as you see
fit, with the restriction that the place described and visited
by the player characters is fairly limited, possibly to the area
surrounding a [[sinkhole]] or the winding path down from a
ruin on the surface.
## CULTURES
There are humanoids living in the Underworld, but they are
scattered and usually have more contact with settlements
on the surface than with each other. Most of them are trolls,
in realms ranging from ten or so individuals cowering under
a single liege troll, to thousands of members – often
gathered around an aged ruler close to entering its third
hibernation. Like humans, the trolls are a heterogeneous
group, but with a clear tendency to despise weakness in all
its forms. The information presented on the trolls’ Origins
(page 86 in the Ruins of Symbaroum Player’s Guide) should
be inspiration enough to design different underground
troll realms.
Goblins prefer to live under the sky, but a few tribes live
out their short lives in the Underworld, by tradition or out
of necessity. In the former case they may be vassals of a
larger troll realm or have managed to defend their right to
a clean and life-giving
“oasis” in the subterranean dark. As
for necessity, it is not uncommon for a tribe to fall out of
favor with some force of the forest – another tribe, an arch
troll, or a domineering Drakworm. Escape might then be
the only alternative, which leads to the tribe members becoming
fearful and unusually aggressive compared to other
woodland goblins.
Ambrian expeditions never stay very long underground,
but if the Gamemaster so desires, it is possible that Ordo
Magica, the [[Queen's Rangers|Queen’s Rangers]] or some foolish noble might
have financed a real outpost on the shore of some night
black lake. It is also possible that undead and severely blight-marked
humans have come together and found a home beneath
the feet of their former brothers and sisters, where
they can live without constantly being met with fear and
hate, and without having to watch out for witch-hunters
and hateful lynch mobs.
## CREATURES
The Ruins of Symbaroum Bestiary provides a number of creatures
described as residents of the Underworld: Gwann,
Spite, World Serpent, Chasm Stag and The Wily, to name a
few. But of course there are also abominations and ghouls, as
well as occasional packs of predators, reclusive King Toads
and crestfallen arch trolls. Not to mention various forms
of Corrupted Nature and Vengeful Terrain. As long as the
Gamemaster can explain why a certain beast or monster
horde has decided to abandon the surface, the player characters
can encounter just about any monster in the depths
of the Underworld.
There is also potential for fiddling with already existing
creatures so that they offer different kinds of challenges. For
starters, they could of course look differently – pale, emaciated,
staring and eerily quiet. But they can also be given
additional features and traits: they might carry the dark
diseases of the Underworld (Infectious), exude corruption
(Harmful Aura), develop the ability to act unhindered in the
dark (Night Perception) or accumulate corruption and use it
in combat (Corruption Hoarder). In short, the dark recesses
of the Underworld and its unsound living conditions can
spawn the most heinous creatures.
