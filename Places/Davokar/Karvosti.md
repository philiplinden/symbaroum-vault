## The Witches
The Huldra [[Yeleta]] and the other two members of the Karvosti node, [[Gadramon]] and [[Eferneya]], live in the ancient caves carved out of the fault line’s wall. Anyone can enter the Antechamber, the great hall directly beyond the cave opening, hoping for an audience with the Arch Witch. But what lies beyond the five, draped openings to the inner caves is unknown to most. One can of course assume that the witches have their lodgings there and everybody knows that there are pathways going both to the upper level of the fault and down into the cliff, but the rest are rumors – rumors about ritual chambers full of bloody remains; about winding tunnels to [[Davokar]]’s dark groundwater springs; about subterranean plantations of toxic as well as healing mushrooms; about caverns occupied by imprisoned abominations.
