![[Anadeas map of the halls of a thousand tears.png]]

Home, seat of power, and training grounds for elves of the [[Iron Pact]].

This small city is completely hidden within Davokar by ancient magic. Only elves are able to locate it independently. [[Iron Pact]] elites may temporarily grant outsiders permission to visit, but they must be led to the location by a charmed beast or an elf.

Autumn elves like [[Eneáno]], [[Mearoel]], and [[Teara-Téana]] manage the halls and [[Iron Pact]] operations day-to-day, but #winter-elf stage elves have the final say.

An eternal elf lives here?
