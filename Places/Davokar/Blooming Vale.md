See: [[@Throne1.BloomingVale]]

Surrounded by thick, lush vegetation that is toxic to undead. The vale was grown around the fortress of [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos]] by [[Eox]] as a means to contain him.

Since the days of Symbaroum, [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos]] has slowly grown an undead army from the unfortunate few who stumble into the vale.
