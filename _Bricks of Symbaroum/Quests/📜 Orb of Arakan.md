Lately, an eerie wave of suicides has swept House Vearra’s outpost. The visiting fortune hunter Kareon was the first to cut open his veins, followed by Vemela, who waited tables at the Victorious Hawk, then the caravan guard Ugero, and finally Slugger, an ogre gladiator turned merchant. The player characters could be sought out on [[Places/Davokar/Karvosti]] as renowned problem-solvers, or be drawn into the story while visiting the outpost. Regardless, those who fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw while staying at the outpost will suffer terrible nightmares; the kind one would rather not talk about – dreams of committing lustful murders, betraying their queen or chieftain, stealing ortegs from wretched beggars, or sacrificing innocents to the dark forces of [[Davokar]]. Every morning, those afflicted by these nightmares must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; with every failure their minds grow darker and the DC increases by 1 for the save. When the DC reaches 20, they will attempt suicide on a failure. The effect remains active for as long as they are situated at (or anywhere near) the outpost; if they leave, the depression wears off after a good night’s sleep. The source of these horrific dreams is a corrupted artifact which Orola keeps hidden in the outpost’s warehouse – a smoky crystal orb containing the spirit of the great spider creature Arakan. There are likely to be other suspicious people at the outpost as well (e.g. a fallen theurg beguiled by the dark powers, a shady Ambrian merchant, and a changeling on the run from Ambrian justice). There could also be rumors of an abomination or some primal creature roaming the nearby woods. In any case, the truth will probably not be uncovered for some time; maybe not until Orola’s buyer, the cult leader Liena, arrives with her followers…
