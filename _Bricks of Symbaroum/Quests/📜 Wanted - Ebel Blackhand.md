For some months now, a band of Ambrian plunderers has terrorized the road between [[Thistle Hold]] and [[Karvosti]]. The [[Queen's Rangers|Queen’s Rangers]] have not been able to hunt them down, and their raids have been extremely costly in terms of both lives and property.

A few days ago, a young pilgrim came to the [[Queen's Legation|Queen’s Legation]] claiming to be absolutely certain that the notorious leader of the group, [[Ebel Blackhand]], could be found on [[Karvosti]]. Lothar brought the news to Tharaban, who had his wrathguards put the bandit in chains. The problem is that the Queen’s Legate lacks the authority to pass judgement over such a major criminal; Ebel must be brought to [[Thistle Hold]] right away!

There is a small coalition proclaiming Ebel's innocence. Attacks on the road have still happened since his capture.

The [[Queen's Legation]] is requesting the bandits be killed or captured. Payment is contingent upon Ebel's return to [[Thistle Hold]] for trial.
