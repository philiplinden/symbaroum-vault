In the [[Sun Temple]] of [[Thistle Hold]], [[Brother Hank]]'s sermons were legendary, but not for the reasons he imagined. Oblivious to his lack of oratory skills, he reveled in his own verbosity, believing himself to be a master of the spoken word. His long-winded sermons were peppered with tangents, meandering anecdotes, and obscure references that left the congregation bewildered.

But it was [[Brother Hank]]'s poetry that truly set him apart. In his spare time, he would lock himself in his study, penning verses that defied logic and reason. His poems were a cacophony of nonsensical rhymes and bizarre metaphors, but he cherished them as masterpieces of literary genius.

One fateful day, during a particularly animated sermon, [[Brother Hank]]'s passion got the better of him. He launched into a spontaneous recitation of one of his poems, completely caught up in the rhythm and rhyme. The congregation stared in bewilderment as he spewed out a nonsensical tirade that left them utterly baffled.

Suddenly, something remarkable happened. As [[Brother Hank]]'s poem reached its crescendo, the [[Sun Temple]] was bathed in a blinding light, and a figure descended from the heavens. It was [[Prios]] himself, the god of the [[Sun Church]], manifesting in all his radiant glory.

[[Brother Hank]] was speechless, his eyes wide with awe. [[Prios]] spoke, his voice resonating with divine authority. "[[Brother Hank]]," he said, "your poetry is... truly unique."

With those words, the god of the [[Sun Church]] vanished, leaving [[Brother Hank]] in a state of ecstatic disbelief. He was convinced that [[Prios]] had recognized his poetic talents and bestowed upon him a divine blessing.

From that day on, [[Brother Hank]]'s sermons became even more bizarre and nonsensical. He interpreted every mundane event as a sign from [[Prios]], weaving them into his sermons with grandiosity. The congregation remained bewildered, but out of respect for their enthusiastic theurg, they continued to nod and smile.

In the end, [[Brother Hank]]'s reputation as a theurg with otherworldly poetic talents grew far and wide. He was celebrated as a living legend, revered for his unwavering belief in his own bizarre and surreal version of reality. And as the years passed, it became whispered among the townspeople that [[Brother Hank]] had indeed achieved a level of divine insight that transcended ordinary comprehension, leaving them with a sense of wonder and bemusement that lasted for generations to come.
