“[[Prios]], *[[Prios|Lawgiver]]*, we behold your warmth and light. Our passion burns in your fire. We see your light through the darkest storm clouds and through the thickest forests, guiding us on the path to civilization and righteousness,” [[Brother Hank]] preached. It was early. A handful of novices struggled to hold their eyes open through [[Brother Hank|Hank]]’s droning sermon despite the bright sunrise filtering through the stained glass mosaics in the upper tower.

[[Anadea]] drew in a deep breath and held it. She saw that self-satisfied upturned corner of the theurg’s mouth that meant the sermon would last another half hour. Hopefully this time the porridge wouldn’t be cold by the time he tired himself out. She stared up at the ceiling. The copper dome capping the [[Sun Temple]] warmed quickly this late summer morning, casting the whole chamber in a thin auburn haze. [[Anadea]] closed her eyes, taking it in, and exhaled a silent prayer, *[[Prios]], give me strength. Forgive me for what I must do.*

After breakfast, [[Anadea]] casually excused herself from the squabble of fellow novices. Once safely around the corner, she quickened her pace. She did her best to hide evidence of her exertions and nervousness through strained but measured breaths. Only a bit further until [[Father Elfeno]]’s study—this was her chance. Nestled between the tower and courtyard, [[Father Elfeno|Elfeno]]’s study was easily one of the quietest chambers in all of the [[Sun Temple]]. It was also, of course, off limits to everyone else. [[Anadea]] rounded the final corner toward her destination.

“Oof!” In a soft thud of robes, the young novice careened into [[Brother Hank]], casting his armful of parchment across the stone hallway. She scrambled to reassemble the sheaf of parchments, apologizing profusely. [[Anadea]] was surprised to find the middle-aged theurg even more nervous than she. His round, shaved head was so flushed it resembled a tomato gone past its prime. Confused, [[Anadea]] glanced down at the neatly penned scriptures.

> **Burning Desire - Volume 2, Chapter 8**
> Hilda gasped when she saw a reflection in the polished stone altar. A glimpse of the chiseled abs and square jaw of the mysterious stranger among the pews behind her was enough for her to recognize him. She turned on her heel, revealing shirtless Alfredo quivering with desire in the aisle of the [[Sun Temple]]. Hilda’s skin warmed, heated by the memory of Alfredo’s [[Water of the Dusk]] on her tongue…

[[Brother Hank|Hank]] snatched the sheaf from [[Anadea]]’s grasp. Her mouth hung agape, staring blankly at the priest. He stared back, sweating. It only took a moment for the pair to reach a silent understanding. [[Brother Hank|Hank]] and [[Anadea]] hurried down the temple halls in opposite directions, eager to forget the meeting.

At last, [[Anadea]] laid a hand on the cool iron latch to the heavy door concealing [[Father Elfeno]]’s study. The room was brightly lit. Rays of sun cut through the musty air, thick with the scent of old parchment. [[anadea]] snoops a little bit. curious. guilty, but thrilled by the forbidden nature of it all. she was looking for a letter or memo. elf contact had suspected secret arrangements between nightpitch and [[Father Elfeno|elfeno]], but [[anadea]] doesn’t know what for.

she finds the letter and reads a few lines but before she can take it, noise. [[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] is back — and with someone. [[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] is caught up in a hushed argument with someone important, someone tied to the exploration of the caves. [[anadea]] hides, but overhears

the companion ([[Queen's Rangers|queen’s rangers]] rep?) argues that there is more to learn about the caves. after all, some of [[Malrek]]’s babblings have been found to be true. [[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] complains that they’ve found nothing and this is pointless. [[Malrek]] is a madman whos mind has gone to shit from corruption. the black cloaks have been breathing down his neck, wanting to take [[Malrek]] to the monastery for “study” (torture? lobotomy?) — [[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] is the only thing in their way right now and nightpitch is testing his patience. [[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] has protected this useless madman for too long. the dungeon reeks of his piss and his howls at night are louder than wolves roaming the [[Titan Mountains|titans]].

[[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] grabs the letter [[anadea]] was about to steal and thrusts it into the chest of the companion with a demand for nightpitch to call off the fool’s errand. He has 3 days to respond, or else [[Malrek]] will be turned over to the black cloaks.

[[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] senses something, but [[anadea]] uses magic to conceal herself. finally he leaves.

scene change. [[anadea]] speaks with [[gwyn]] at night to report findings. [[gwyn]] is an [[iron pact]] agent and changeling with some notable characteristic. [[anadea]] tells [[gwyn]] that she’ll be heading down to speak with [[Malrek]] herself. [[gwyn]] warns [[anadea]] not to get greedy or nosy. some things are best left unknown.

[[anadea]] sneaks down to the dungeon after bed time. she uses some more magic to conceal herself on the way down, but can feel the corruption welling in her veins.

the guard in the dungeon is asleep. [[Malrek]] is telling a story, maybe a puppet show? to imaginary audience, who heckles him. [[anadea]] approaches slowly, as if approaching a dangerous and wild animal. [[Malrek]] sees her and flips out like she is “one of them” other theurgs, who possibly have ridiculed him or done minor inhumane things. [[anadea]] is calm and gentle. she pities him, and feels ashamed for feeling pity. 

[[Malrek]] reveals a few bits and pieces about the caves and the crystal lake and the [[beast clan]] and such. it sounds like nonsense, but he clearly believes it (cthulhu style).

eventually he gets so worked up that he grabs [[anadea]] through the bars. she yelps, he yells and shouts ominous but incoherent things in her face, wetting it with spit. this commotion wakes the guard.

[[anadea]] has to escape the dungeon. there’s a minor chase scene.

[[anadea]] nearly makes it out. but [[Father Elfeno|elfeno]] is on her heels. he uses magic.

it is ambiguous whether [[anadea]] makes it out. we cut here to preserve suspense.

%% ending to the story from Bard
Anadea took a deep breath and opened the door to Father Elfeno's study. The room was brightly lit, with rays of sun cutting through the musty air, thick with the scent of old parchment. Anadea's eyes adjusted to the light, and she saw Father Elfeno sitting at his desk, his head bent over a book.

"Father Elfeno," Anadea said, her voice soft.

Father Elfeno looked up from his book and smiled. "Anadea," he said. "What can I do for you?"

"I need your help," Anadea said. "I've done something terrible, and I don't know what to do."

Father Elfeno's smile faded. "What is it, Anadea?" he asked.

Anadea took a deep breath. "I've been reading forbidden books," she said. "Books that are banned by the Sun Church."

Father Elfeno's eyes widened. "Forbidden books?" he asked. "What kind of books?"

"Books about the Dark Powers," Anadea said. "Books about the things that dwell in the Davokar Forest."

Father Elfeno shook his head. "Anadea, you mustn't read those books," he said. "They are dangerous."

"I know," Anadea said. "But I couldn't help myself. I needed to know the truth."

"The truth is dangerous," Father Elfeno said. "It is better to live in ignorance."

"But I can't live in ignorance," Anadea said. "I need to know what's out there."

Father Elfeno sighed. "Very well," he said. "I will tell you what I know. But you must promise me that you will never tell anyone else."

"I promise," Anadea said.

Father Elfeno leaned forward and spoke in a low voice. "The Dark Powers are ancient and evil," he said. "They were banished from the world long ago, but they are always trying to return. They are the source of all the evil in the world."

"What can we do to stop them?" Anadea asked.

"We can't stop them," Father Elfeno said. "We can only hope to contain them. The Sun Church is the only thing that stands between the Dark Powers and the world."

"But what if the Sun Church is not strong enough?" Anadea asked.

"Then the world is doomed," Father Elfeno said.

Anadea stood up. "I need to go," she said.

"Where are you going?" Father Elfeno asked.

"I'm going to the Davokar Forest," Anadea said. "I need to find out more about the Dark Powers."

"No, Anadea," Father Elfeno said. "It's too dangerous."

"I have to do this," Anadea said. "I'm the only one who can."

Anadea turned and walked out of the study, leaving Father Elfeno sitting at his desk, his head in his hands.
