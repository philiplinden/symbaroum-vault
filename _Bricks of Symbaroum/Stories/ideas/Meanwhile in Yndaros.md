## Brewing Conflicts
1. The relationship between elves and humans is strained.
	1. Elves are known to resent #ambrian humans for basically pillaging [[Davokar]].
	2. Elves have been known to take violent action against humans, especially Ambrians.
2. The weapons-making guild is threatening to revoke support for the crown.
	1. [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]]'s family is angry about the new guild regulations because the oversight is intense and cutting into profits.
	2. The economic advisors to [[Queen Korinthia]] support the new guild regulations because they want to fight poverty and crime in the city. [[Artek Alzerek]]'s family is their prime example.
	3. The [[Knights of the Dying Sun|Templars]], [[Twilight Friars|Black Cloaks]], Queen's Legate, and Fortune Hunter reps all want more weapons to fight elves (and other beasts of [[Davokar]], and are afraid of the impact that the guild withdrawing will have on their preparedness against another elf attack.
3. The [[Sun Church]] captured [[Malrek]] who claims that an attack on [[Thistle Hold]] is imminent. Controversy over the severity of the threat is still thick with debate.
	1. [[Twilight Friars|Black Cloaks]] interrogated him. Things originally believed to be some sort of coded message (or plain nonsense) have recently been corroborated.
	2. The claim is that a series of tunnels run beneath the hold, and remnants of the [[Beast Clan]] are planning to return.
	3. The investigation by [[Queen's Legation]] and Odav scouts was called off and caves were never fully mapped.
## Story Beats
Wide angle shot of [[Yndaros]].
Fly down to Doudram river, zoom past trade ships large and small.
Enter the [[Harbor District]] and glimpse at trade and [[Tibzibsee]] affairs.
Fly over palace walls and into a tower window.

Reveal the council, mid-argument.
Establish some context, but be subtle—no “speaking for the sake of the audience” lines, please.
Introduce each stakeholder.
- The [[Queen's council]] meets with Guild Masters and high-ranking officials of the [[Sun Church]] and [[Ordo Magica]].
	- The Queen is not in attendance at the start
- Guild Masters quarrel about the armorer's guild being undercut for the 4th year in a row by [[Master Alinard]] and other "outsiders".
	- The Blacksmith's Guild's Grand Master Petrona Steelwife has not found a lawful way to prohibit [[Master Alinard|Alinard]] from using the title of Master
	- Spreading rumors and unfounded accusations that [[Master Alinard|Alinard]] is spying on Ambrian armories in order to give intel to barbarian clans.
- [[Tibzibsee]] threatens to pull out of their arms agreement with the crown.
	- The agreement right now makes sales of advanced weaponry exclusive to [[Queen's Legation]].
	- Pulling out of the agreement would allow them to sell advanced weaponry to the public.
	- Breaking the agreement incurs a massive fee, but the company is wealthy as hell.
- The [[Sun Church]] is furious because the technological edge is what is believed to be holding the line against aggression from the [[Iron Pact]], (figuratively and literally).
	- They also fearmonger about renewed unrest and instabilities from latent barbarian clansfolk living in [[Ambria]].

Just before the politics of economic affairs becomes dull, interrupt with the Queen’s entrance.
Describe the Queen in evocative detail.
Catch whisperings illustrating how locals feel about elves.
- [[Queen Korinthia]] arrives with [[Elori]] in tow. 
	- She dismisses the argument at hand and gives the floor to [[Elori]].
	- Whispers flutter between humans in attendance. Rumors, doubts, resentment, and callbacks to [[Aloéna's Visit]].

Set the scene for impetus of WotW: [[colossi]] have left [[Places/Davokar/Karvosti]] for [[Thistle Hold]].
- [[Elori]] shares news from contacts in [[Davokar]]:
	- [[Yeleta]], the Huldra (leader of the witches) in [[Places/Davokar/Karvosti]], has been frequently meeting with the High Chieftan but nobody knows why for sure.
	- Scouts in [[Davokar]] reported that witches have summoned [[colossi]] and began moving south toward [[Thistle Hold]] at [[Yeleta]]'s order.
		- Since the council is mostly Ambrian humans, he also explains context for what [[colossi]] are and why this is significant.

Outrage and fear, but mystery. Wounds are still fresh, tensions are high, but everyone is war-weary and afraid.
