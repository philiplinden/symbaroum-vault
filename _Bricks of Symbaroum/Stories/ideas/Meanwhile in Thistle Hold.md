## Plot
Show what [[Anadea]] has been up to while [[The Party]] has been away.
She covertly reads forbidden texts in [[Father Elfeno]]’s study within [[Sun Temple]].
Bits and pieces of drama with [[Father Sarvola]], set up why [[Deseba the Old|Deseba]] wants to protect him?

Hearing voices, [[Anadea]] hides.
Show an interaction between [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]], high ranking members of the [[Sun Church]], [[Twilight Friars|Black Cloaks]], etc. where they debate the value in continuing a search for the crazy ramblings of a blighted monster hunter.
- [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] knows that if what [[Malrek]] says is true, all of [[Thistle Hold]] is in danger.
- [[Twilight Friars|Black Cloaks]] want to take [[Malrek]] to the monastery to study his blight.
- [[Sun Church]] want to find the headquarters of the [[Iron Pact]] (and destroy it).
- [[Ordo Magica]] want to study geography of possible tunnel network, the underworld, and possible unknown barbarian clans.

[[Malrek]] is blighted and riddled with stigma. He is in agony—mentally and physically.
- [[Twilight Friars]] have tortured him.
- [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] himself interrogated him.

	- Lovecraftian?

Convey the severity of the danger of being found out.
	- Maybe she tricks someone into being at the wrong place/wrong time and facing the consequence?
	- Consequence is a branding over the eye and going in the dungeon too?

[[Anadea]] leaves the [[Sun Temple]] to hide her notes with [[Gwyn]]. 
- Almost get caught. Does [[Brother Hank]] make a cameo? or [[Kevin]]?
- want the impression that she got away, but the fear that it was close
