Bright-eyed [[Bartolom]], silver-tongued [[Niho]], and keen-witted [[Termo]] have received letters from one [[People/Master Vernam]] to investigate the terror brought about in [[Thistle Hold]] by [[Alahara]].

[[Bartolom]] arrives in [[Queen's Square]] where [[Niho]] is hocking her [[Cut-Co Knives]]. [[Termo]] has arrived in the plaza to “shake down” shady vendors on behalf of the tax collector’s office. He picks on [[Niho]] for a bit.

A frantic young girl latches on to [[Niho]] in desperation, hoping for respite from a group of thugs calling themselves [[Twilight Friars|Black Cloak]]s. The girl, [[Tenid]], hides under [[Niho]]’s table.

The thugs are henchmen working for [[Baumelo]]. They demand that [[Tenid]] be handed over to them _or else_. The thugs confirm rumors floating in the crowd that [[Tenid]] herself is [[Alahara]], and the guise of an innocent girl is a sinister illusion. [[Niho]] and [[Termo]] stand up for the girl (“what girl?”) but things go south. [[Tenid]] flees for back alleys.

[[Bartolom]] sees all of these events transpire and steps in to help the innocent. Combat ensues. [[Termo]] transforms [[Tenid]] into a dog for a time and she escapes. The thugs sustain a few injuries and flee, still looking for the girl and vowing revenge from [[Baumelo]].

The unlikely group realizes they’ve all been contacted by [[People/Master Vernam]] to investigate [[Alahara]], and doubt that [[Tenid]] has anything to do with it. 

They decide to get acquainted and discuss the task ahead over some refreshments at a nearby tavern.
