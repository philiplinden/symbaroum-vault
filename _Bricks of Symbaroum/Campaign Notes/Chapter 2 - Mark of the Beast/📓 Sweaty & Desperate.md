The crew inspected the scene of [[Alahara]]â€™s latest victim â€” a stable boy. The crew talks to a witness and finds a blood trail. The crew discovers from the Medicusâ€™s notes that all of the victims have been missing several specific glands. [[Baumelo]] shows up and helps the crew follow the trail to the [[Blue Moon]].

[[Weston Sawyer|Weston]] eventually gets inside.
