## The Bell Tolls
When the crew emerges from the ruins, a lone bell is heard chiming. It is the alarm bell by the [[North Gate]] of the palisade.
- The bell tolls for the first time in more than four years!
- Historically this bell was rung to warn the town of impending attack, usually at the hand of elves.
- The last major offensive was [[Attack of Eloan-Eo]] and smaller skirmishes in its aftermath.

Shouting voices are heard from outside. People are moving towards the Promenade. The Town Watch and a part of the garrison in the Hold are heading for the [[North Gate]].

By the northern gate house stands [[Captain Marvello]], ordering a growing number of town guards to push people away from the closed gates. The only ones to be let through are the few [[Queen's Rangers|Queen‚Äôs Rangers]] who currently have [[Thistle Hold]] as their base of operations. The bystanders reluctantly back away, and many among them are not content standing down on the [[Toad's Square|Toad‚Äôs Square]] but try to reach the battlement of the palisade or the roof of one of the buildings that are high enough to compete with the thirty-foot-high wall.

Shortly after the characters have found their spot, loud creaking and crashing is heard from the forest edge, about two hundred paces away. The silence that settles among the assembled quickly turns into a collective inhalation when the cause of the alarm emerges ‚Äì two [[colossi]], at least the height of three men, like enormous oxen but with bodies made from plant fibers instead of from flesh and muscles. Standing on their backs are two barbarian witches, dressed in multicolored felt dresses and with primitive masks covering their faces. The colossal mounts come to a halt about fifty paces from the palisade.

Down in the square, the captain has watched the whole thing through a window and reached the conclusion that this is not an assault. Instead he starts putting together a delegation to walk out and meet with the witches.

‚ÄîEND OF SESSION‚Äî

## A Warning
As soon as the welcoming committee is assembled, the [[North Gate]] opens and [[Captain Marvello]] starts walking. The witches remain still, waiting on the backs of their [[colossi]]. The procession stops a few paces away and [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] turns to his interpreter. If this is one of the player characters, he or she is left to handle the conversation with the witches ‚Äì [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] seems to understand what is said but is unable to converse in the barbarian tongue.

The interpreter is ordered to welcome them to the Ambrian realm, whereby one of the witches nods in response and presents himself as [[Gadramon]], sent by [[Yeleta]], the Huldra of [[Places/Davokar/Karvosti]] (a character with the ability Loremaster knows that one of the Huldra‚Äôs closest helpers bears that same name). 

After that, the interpreter is asked to learn why they have come. [[Gadramon]] responds with a counter-question: ‚ÄúHas the well spoken?‚Äù When no one seems to comprehend what the witch refers to, he sternly comments: ‚ÄúNo answer is answer enough.‚Äù The witch then asks for passage into the town and when asked why he says that they are here to help and that ‚Äúthe Huldra fears that a very potent source of corruption dwells at the heart of [[Thistle Hold]]‚Äù. More he cannot say. 

[[Gadramon]] claims that time is short and when [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] states that he is not able to give them passage without the express permission of [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]], the witch stresses that such permission must be granted right now. In the meantime, he and [[Eferneya]] will return to the forest edge and wait.
