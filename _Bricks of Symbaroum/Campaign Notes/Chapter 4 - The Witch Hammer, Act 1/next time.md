The "termites" are [[Blood Roaches]]. They paralyze and carry off victims to their hive. They have acid blood and attack in swarms like killer bees and wasps.

[[Ambrian March on Karvosti]] event has begun.

[[The Party]] is travelling northward with a caravan. There are three wagons, including the Cutco-sponsored wagon [[the party]] has rented. One wagon is transporting smithed goods (swords, spears, armor, etc.). The other wagon is carrying manufactured goods from [[Yndaros]] like cloth and clothing, potions, and leathercrafts.

## Cinematic

The wagon creaked and groaned beneath its heavy load, its wooden wheels cutting shallow tracks through the muddy forest path. Ser Aldric Voss adjusted the grip on his weathered longsword, his eyes constantly scanning the shadows between the twisted, ancient trees of [[Davokar]].

"We should make camp before nightfall," growled Marta, the caravan's lead trader. Her face was weathered like old leather, etched with scars that spoke of countless journeys through these treacherous lands. Her fingers, calloused from years on the road, absently traced the protective runes sewn into her leather jerkin.

Young Jesper, the youngest of their guards, nervously fingered the iron-tipped crossbow at his side. "The woods feel... wrong today," he muttered.

Aldric knew that feeling. The darkness between the trees seemed to breathe, to watch. Symbaroum was not a land for the weak or the unwary. Every shadow could hide a goblin raider, a forest spirit with ancient grudges, or something far worse.

Their cargo was precious - rare herbs from the southern territories, mystical components that would fetch a king's ransom in [[Karvosti]]. But the price of such treasure was paid in blood and terror.

As twilight began to settle, a distant howl echoed through the forest. Not the cry of any wolf Aldric had ever heard.

The journey was far from over, and the night was young.
