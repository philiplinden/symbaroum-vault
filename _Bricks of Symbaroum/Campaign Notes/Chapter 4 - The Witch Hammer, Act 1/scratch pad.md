[[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor nightpitch]] watches the treeline with concern. Veterans of [[Town Watch|the Guard]] still have nightmares about the last raid on [[Thistle Hold]] almost 10 years ago by an [[Iron Pact]] warband. An undead army hundreds strong lays seige to the town from the treeline. A few scouting parties are handily dealt with by the well equipped guards stop the palisade. The full might of [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]'s army make preparations at the forest edge, crafting crude battering rams and ladders from the woods. The seige only lasts a day. At nightfall NE gets impatient and leads his army to march on TH at twilight. The TH force is not prepared to defend against a force this large. When not half of the army has left [[Davokar]] into the "no man's land" between TH and [[Davokar]], war sounds, torchlight, and the clap of hooves engulf the forest edge. The two [[colossi]] charge into the flanks in front of [[thistle hold]]. Yips and howls are heard from the skirmish -- unmistakeably an [[iron pact]] warband battle cry! Forces split the undead army disintegrates. The warband slays most of the force, and Guards and [[Colossi|Coloss]] take care of the rest. The next day, an autumn elf (the same elf you saw at the corrupted cemetery between here and [[Melima]]) presents [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]'s head to Nightpitch marking a tenuous peace between the two factions. He informs Nightpitch of the deeds your party has done in [[Davokar]] (nothing about [[Melima]]). The [[Colossi|Coloss]] riding witches have their status launched from pariahs to heroes in town, and they credit your party to their success. There is maybe a week of celebrations but after that the town moves on. Your party is held in high regard but more and more adventurers forget your names or doubt your claims to be the heroes they heard about. Work begins to fill in the [[sinkhole]] and build structures across the pit. This leads to massive demand for labor. The refugee camp and [[blackmoor]] swell with new arrivals.

[[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] was visited by an agent from his family a few days after the major battle at [[Thistle Hold]]. In the days that followed, he decided to temporarily settle within the town and start helping the cleanup and reconstruction efforts in his free time. Utilizing his expertise with explosives for the cleanup effort around the pit. He is beginning to build up rapport and fame with the locals. Those closest to him have shared his ambitions to open an inn.

[[Kerido]] is going a bit more undeath-obsessed. With all the undead strewn around the battlefield, I think he goes a bit mad-scientist and collects samples. This is likely done in some level of secrecy. At least hidden from the general populace of Thistlehold. He'd likely meet up with others to conduct his research. Maybe [[Master Eufrynda|Knockers]] or some other Ordo folks, maybe a Sun priest too. I think he tries to get [[Anadea]] interested but I think she is very anti-experimentation after her experience being captured and tortured. He still goes for Zweigles near the fighting arena. He meets up with Kargon every now and then, helping with reconstruction here and there. Still has the room at the original inn but spends more time at his "lab" than anywhere else. His lab is a hodge podge of small shacks and tables and crates down in the pit by the big ass crystal.

[[Broad pod Eightmeterslong]]: A towering 7'8" Ogre witch, wearing well kept layered smooth fabrics, and carrying a pack full of scrolls. He showed up soon after undead attack, and was introduced and recommended to the group by [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] - their shared past is still not entirely clear yet. He has spent his recent weeks learning about [[Thistle Hold]], its people, culture, religion and and mystic knowledge he can get a hold of. Not much is known of his past and his time with the witches yet, and as you'd imagine it takes some time for the townspeople to warm up to him, but he has now established some friends and acquaintances
