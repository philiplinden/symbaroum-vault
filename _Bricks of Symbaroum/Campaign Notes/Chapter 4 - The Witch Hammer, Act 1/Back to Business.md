[[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] had assumed that he had known, from his street smarts alone, that he could handle anything. The last few months squashed that and it took him by surprise. Since we last saw him, [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] made an effort to become truly proficient with his main weapon: the boomstick. In the process he developed some new ammunition types and made new connections in [[Thistle Hold]]. Today his is better equipped, his equipment is polished. He's also developed a taste for ale. He's pudgier and more muscular. More well built, in all senses. He keeps a full beard now instead of a short goatee.

[[Kerido]] hasn't given up his quest to learn more about undeath, but it's taken more of a back seat while he helps [[Smellia]], [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]], and [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]]with their own activities. Eventually he has become more insular and focused on his research. Having tapped out his resources in [[Thistle Hold]], he went on a few minor excursions into [[Davokar]]. After one of those excursions, he developed splitting headaches. When that happens he blacks out for hours, sometimes days. When he wakes up he is covered in frost. Hood and cloak covering the majority of his face (revealing only his eyes and the bridge of his nose). Listening and watching.

[[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] just got back from a religious retreat with the Reformed Brothers of [[Prios]]. After the last months, it's cemented his belief that the church won't come around to his side. He found refuge from the losing ideological battle with a group of like-minded folks in the RBP. At the retreat they did exercises and searching for his spiritual center. He hasn't given up on [[Prios]] but he has given up on the Church. The retreat was located near the [[Kalea-Ma Har Cemetery]]. Calming physical retreat, but [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] is in spiritual turmoil. He no longer wears his church of [[prios]] robes and paraphernalia. Still wears the symbol of [[prios]]. He stomped his church crackpipe to pieces.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] is a bit distant as well. He has returned to his craft: monster hunting. Recent events would have been easier if he had better trapmaking skills. (He is the only one truly interested in [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]]'s stories). [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] is proficient in mechanical traps. Various expeditions deeper and deeper into the area of [[Davokar]] between [[Melima]] and [[Thistle Hold]]. Climbing the hunting guild's leaderboard (300 of 1800). He has improved his garb so that it instead of one earth tone it is camouflaged on one side for the hunt: one side is forest, the other side is black. 

[[Smellia]] is looking to "get out of the game" with Cutco.

There is time in the season for one more "good run" to [[Karvosti]] before winter sets in. Merchants are trying their best to get the last shipments to [[Karvosti]]. [[Smellia]] heard of a large shipment of iron from [[Karvosti]] a little while ago, and the caravan is preparing to bring back manufactured goods to [[Karvosti]]. Cutco associates are also running a caravan, not looking forward having to pay off the bandits.

[[The party]] is interested in the bulletin [[ðŸ“œ Wanted - Ebel Blackhand]]
- [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] wants to get back to adventuring. Whack some baddies. Get stabbed. Either/or.
- [[Kerido]], [[Smellia]] and [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] want an excuse to go back into the forest. None of them care to pick sides yet.

The bulletin has other quest options [[the party]] is interested in doing to cover the cost of travel. Sponsored by Cutco knives. The side quests are slightly out of the way â€” extra risk and danger to go off trail.
- kill the black plague termites â€” these ones are flesh-eating!
	- ![[Pasted image 20241114000437.png]]
- suicide mystery (orb of arakan) (p108 throne of thorns)
- escort a shipment of goods

[[The party]] decides to accept Cutco sponsorship. They get plenty of (cheap) rations as long as they use a custom obnoxiously painted canvas for the wagon. [[The party]] buys two draft horses and a wagon. Travel as a convoy with two other groups: some mercs, a wilderness guide, and a bunch of goblin laborers.
# GM Notes
Rumors have started to spread about a fortune hunter that has discovered [[Symbar]]. Of course the truth has been lost along the way, but the allure of treasure and a long-lost city of legend has only stoked the flames. The story has quickly become the number one topic in [[Salons of Symbaroum|salons]] and taverns, even surfacing in small talk among nobles and elites.

[[Karvosti]] is known for more sinkholes leading to the [[Underworld]], ruins and artifacts, and lots of opportunities for adventure. 

### Wanted: [[Ebel Blackhand]]
For some months now, a band of Ambrian plunderers has terrorized the road between [[Thistle Hold]] and [[Karvosti]]. The [[Queen's Rangers|Queenâ€™s Rangers]] have not been able to hunt them down, and their raids have been extremely costly in terms of both lives and property.

A few days ago, a young pilgrim came to the [[Queen's Legation|Queenâ€™s Legation]] claiming to be absolutely certain that the notorious leader of the group, [[Ebel Blackhand]], could be found on [[Karvosti]]. Lothar brought the news to Tharaban, who had his wrathguards put the bandit in chains. The problem is that the Queenâ€™s Legate lacks the authority to pass judgement over such a major criminal; Ebel must be brought to [[Thistle Hold]] right away!

There is a small coalition proclaiming Ebel's innocence. Attacks on the road have still happened since his capture.

The Legation is requesting the bandits be killed or captured. Payment is contingent upon Ebel's return to [[Thistle Hold]] for trial.

## Updates
I think when he fails the check with headaches or blood lust, Ice Storm, my new 4th level spell, casts centered on himself (not hurting himself, but he is unmoving in the center of this effect).
