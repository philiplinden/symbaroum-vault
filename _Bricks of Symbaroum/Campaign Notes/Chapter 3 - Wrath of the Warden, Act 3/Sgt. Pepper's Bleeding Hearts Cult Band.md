# GM Notes

Autumn has begun in earnest. Dark thunderclouds are rolling in from the west.

The rats have weakened the roof/awning on one side of the tannery, it is on the verge of collapse.



## Race Against The Cult
Inside the tannery are a handful of cultists working the tannery.
Six [[Sellswords of the Sun]] mercs patrol to keep the cultists working and keep passersby from snooping. Feels like a meth cookhouse.
There is a catwalk of sorts with guards patrolling there too.

There is a clear space leading to the basement here. Stairs with torchlight.

[[Desidera]] is arguing with [[Kevin]] in the back, complaining about the guards not being attentive and slacking off.
### Confrontation at the [[Cultist Tannery]]

When [[the party]] is discovered, it takes 2-4 rounds to cast a spell that opens the portal. (See [[#Escape]]). The ritual itself is a juiced up version of _Blink_ that takes less time to cast and lasts longer. The [[Codex Ambreagosa]] is responsible for "supercharging" this spell. The spell lasts `2 * rounds to cast` rounds.

When [[Desidera]] sees that [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] has fled, she casts an evil version of _Magic Circle_ that teleports her to circle in [[Ordo Tower]]. It takes 1 full round of concentration to complete.

### Escape 
A ritual is used with [[Codex Ambreagosa]] (consuming the item) and opens a portal to the [[Crystal Isle]] through the [[Yonderworld]]. This ritual causes all in the vicinity to suffer loads of corruption, and temporarily stunned which ends up turning about half of the cultists into blight beasts.

[[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] and [[Manaloum]] escape through the portal. It closes behind them.
