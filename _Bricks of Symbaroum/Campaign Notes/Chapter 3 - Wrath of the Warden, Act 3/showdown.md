# GM Notes

Autumn has begun in earnest. Dark thunderclouds are rolling in from the west.
![[smaug18_a_large_sunlit_park_in_a_city_of_plain_wooden_buildings_22b834fd-c894-4bb1-bb08-4d8526ec0160.png]]

The rats have weakened the roof/awning on one side of the tannery, it is on the verge of collapse.

[[The party]] manages to get a look inside, and is then ratted out by [[Lorraine]].

## Race Against The Cult
Inside the tannery are a handful of cultists working the tannery.
Six [[Sellswords of the Sun]] mercs patrol to keep the cultists working and keep passersby from snooping. Feels like a meth cookhouse.
There is a catwalk of sorts with guards patrolling there too.

There is a clear space leading to the basement here. Stairs with torchlight.

[[Desidera]] is arguing with [[Kevin]] in the back, complaining about the guards not being attentive and slacking off.
### Confrontation at the [[Cultist Tannery]]
![[smaug18_a_large_empty_podium_covered_in_black_cloth_in_a_the_ce_0346d8d8-ba03-4eb4-b6fb-afc8126d0ff6.png]]
When [[the party]] is discovered, it takes 2-4 rounds to cast a spell that opens the portal. (See [[#Escape]]). The ritual itself is a juiced up version of _Blink_ that takes less time to cast and lasts longer. The [[Codex Ambreagosa]] is responsible for "supercharging" this spell. The spell lasts `2 * rounds to cast` rounds.

When [[Desidera]] sees that [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] has fled, she casts an evil version of _Magic Circle_ that teleports her to circle in [[Ordo Tower]]. It takes 1 full round of concentration to complete.

### Escape 
A ritual is used with [[Codex Ambreagosa]] (consuming the item) and opens a portal to the [[Crystal Isle]] through the [[Yonderworld]]. This ritual causes all in the vicinity to suffer loads of corruption, and temporarily stunned which ends up turning about half of the cultists into blight beasts.

[[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] and [[Manaloum]] escape through the portal. It closes behind them.

â†’ If the players enter the [[Yonderworld]], there is a battle.
	[[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] continues to flee while his subordinates stall [[the party]]. Monsters hostile to both groups cause trouble.
â†’ If the players do not go to the [[Yonderworld]], set a timer for 3 "loose rounds" where players can act in any order. Each round takes 5 mins or so.
	At the end of the timer, the ritual begins whether or not the players are there. (See [[#Showdown vs Erlaber]]). After one 5 min round, [[#Phase II]] is complete. [[#Phase III]] takes another 5 min round to complete. After two "loose rounds", the transformation is complete.
### Siege
[[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]'s Horde attempts to siege [[Thistle Hold]] from the north. [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]] was headed to the Hold to recover [[Codex Ambreagosa]]. When it is destroyed, he seeks to destroy [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] or absorb power of the [[crystal isle]] for himself if [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] is already dead.

[[Iron Pact]] elf warriors attack the horde, but do not go out of their way to protect [[Thistle Hold]]. They wish to eliminate the corrupt threat, but don't care if Ambrians are worse off. The horde is hundreds, maybe thousands strong.

This siege occupies the local military force under [[Captain Marvello]], and they do not notice activity in the [[Sinkhole]].

But the force is split! Half of the horde floods the tunnels beneath [[Thistle Hold]], drawn to the [[Crystal Isle]]. 

### Preparation
[[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] and company emerge from the portal on the other side. They battle and slay some Arachs, and gravely wound the troll dude. The Arachs manage to get a message out to [[the Party]] to notify them of cultist arrival if they haven't yet figured it out.

â†’ If [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] made it this far, proceed to [[#Showdown vs Erlaber]].
â†’ If [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] is dead, proceed to [[#Showdown vs Na-Ethikel]].
## Showdown vs [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]]
![[Pasted image 20240213220606.png]]
### Phase I
(pre-combat, as [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] approaches the isle)

People who have the Shadow-sight
feat or 5 or more permanent Corruption can sense
rhythmic tremors in the air, like blast waves caused by the
beating of a powerful heart.

A ritual with [[Eox]]'s head initiates the transformation. [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] multilates the head atop the [[crystal isle]] to consume its power.

The surviving Arachs join forces with [[The Party]] against the horde and cultists.

Set a timer for 6 rounds.

### Phase II
(round 1-2)

The blast waves grow in strength until they can
actually be heard. A character with a passive Perception of 15 or higher discerns a sound reminiscent of the slow but
accelerating beating of a heart. It is not possible to determine
from where the sound comes â€“ it feels like it permeates
the whole world.

Dozens, then hundreds of 1 HP dragouls fall into the [[sinkhole]] and rise, ignoring injuries and with enough vigor to still do damage. They attack anyone around, including cultists.

### Phase III
(rounds 3-5)

The sound
of the heartbeats grows even louder and is made physically
manifest: the sound waves emit a faint, etheric, bright
blue light, like waves from a stone thrown in water, but in
spheres instead of rings. Moreover, everyone feels how the
surges bring with them an instant nausea that inspires dark
thoughts and murderous impulses.

Erlaber transforms into the _Prince of the Abyss_
![[Pasted image 20240213220510.png]]![[Pasted image 20240213230326.png]]

### Phase IV
(round 6)

frantic heartbeat suddenly dies out. A grave-like
silence descends over Thistle
Hold.  the creature that
once was [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] Ambreagos rises from the abyss, on its
new, enormous bat wings (see Showdown on the Surface, page
99). the abomination wreak havoc
among people and houses, causing death and destruction
before leaving the town, headed for Davokarâ€™s deeper and
darker parts (see Triumph of the Night, page 103).

## Showdown vs [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]
[[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]] rushes the tunnels below thistle hole with a part of the horde.
His goal is to reach the [[crystal isle]].

Na ethikel reaches the [[sinkhole]] at the same time as [[the party]]. They come from one of the northern tunnels.

If [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|na-ethikel]] touches the crystal, he transforms into a megazord.

Every round, 10 more Dragouls and 1 warrior? zombie arrive on the scene.
