[[The Party]] decides to check out the [[Sun Temple]] for extra intel before leaving town.
[[Brother Hank]] makes his first appearance.

[[Father Elfeno]] asks [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] and company to [[ðŸ“œ Find the missing Templars]]. He doesnâ€™t give any more context besides their last known whereabouts near [[Melima]].

[[Anadea]] secretively asks [[The Party]] to meet her at [[Toad's Square|Toadâ€™s Square]].

Later that night, after grabbing supplies (including rations, climbing gear, and [[Zweigels]]), [[The Party]] stakes out the square.
[[Anadea]] meets [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]]â€”[[Kerido]] is hidden but within earshot. [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] gets drunk at the [[Salons of Symbaroum|Salons]]. She reveals herself as an agent of the [[Iron Pact]], and advises [[the party]] to ally with them too.

Several [[Sellswords of the Sun]] flank the covert meeting, apparently out to kidnap or kill [[Anadea]].
- [[The Party]] fends off the attackers, killing two subordinates and severely wounding [[Kevin]].
- [[Kevin]] escapes. One member of the [[Sellswords of the Sun]] is captured.
- [[Anadea]] is lightly wounded and mentally shaken.
	- She fears retribution for her involvement with elf affairs.
	- [[Kerido]] advises her to take refuge and lay low with his uncle, [[Uncle Sam]]
	- [[Anadea]] refuses, believing her safety to be easier protected within the walls of the [[Sun Temple]]. She also knew the inner workings of the church and how to lay low there; with no experience evading the law, her chances surviving on the streets were not good even with help from [[Uncle Sam]]
