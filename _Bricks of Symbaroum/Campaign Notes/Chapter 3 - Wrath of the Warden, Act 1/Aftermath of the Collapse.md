[[The Party]] is very critical of [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]]'s handling of the situation, and call him inept. They convince him to vouch for their competence to [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]]. 

[[Kerido]] learns from [[Gadramon]] and warns him that [[Eox]] has fallen silent, curiously coinciding with these events.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] notices the group is being followed and sets a trap that ensnares [[Anadea]]. She tells them where her notes are and shows the note from [[Teara-TÃ©ana]]. She tells [[the party]] not to come looking if she doesn't come back.

[[The Party]] gets an audience [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] and [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] gets him to endorse them to go to the [[sinkhole]]. He won't let the witches in because it would cause chaos, but [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] wants to sneak them in through tunnels.

There are caves and tunnels rumored to be in Symbarian ruins near the forest edge that lead southward toward [[Thistle Hold]].

[[Ganderald]] is sent to accompany [[the party]] ([[Kullinan Furia]] offers too, but [[the party]] decides not to take him) and make observations and research notes.

As they leave the [[Ordo Tower]], a goblin hands them a note. He reveals that it was given to him by a changeling. [[Craigsforth]] claims to work for [[Kerido]] now, and [[Kerido]] tells him to go back to the [[Karabbadokks]] and spread good word about [[The Party]].

## GM Notes
Aside from a few rock slides, there is absolute silence from the [[sinkhole]]. However, when the anxiety has started to fade and tired smiles can be seen on the defendersâ€™ lips, a sudden and worrying sound is heard from the [[sinkhole]] â€“ a rustling, shuffling sound, as if a giant serpent was moving about down in the dark. The sound grows stronger; everyone grows tense. Then the sound diminishes again, as if its source has moved on, away from the [[sinkhole]], deeper down into the Abyss.

### Approaching the [[Sinkhole]]
All who approach the sinkhole without having a proper permit (that is, a signed document where the town authorities state that the person may do so) will be forever banned from the town of [[Thistle Hold]]. This is the case until [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] decides differently, whenever that may be.

### Who is around?
- [[Kullinan Furia]], [[Master Eufrynda]]
	- Out of the two wizards, [[Master Eufrynda]] is the most talkative. Not that she knows much about what has happened, but she claims to be confident that [[Lasifor Nightpitch]] will turn to the orderâ€™s tower for help in figuring out the truth behind the events and maybe also in arranging a descent down the sinkhole. She cannot promise the characters that they can come along, but if they did well in the fight against the [[Beast Clan]] she recommends that they should contact Chapter [[Master Cornelio]].
- [[Captain Marvello]]
	- The captain is totally focused on getting the palisade in place. Getting him to spare a moment will require a passed test against Persuasive by someone connected to the Ambrian army or [[Thistle Hold]]â€™s [[Town Watch]] (the trait Contacts with the right profile), or that they have had dealings with him before. If the test fails they get to talk to one of his sergeants, who takes notes for a report on the events. But that report will not be read by anyone until much later.
	- The orders of [[Captain Marvello]] are clear and he aims to carry them out to the letter: no one approaches the sinkhole without the express permission of [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]]. Aside from that he cannot be of much help â€“ he knows nothing of the hole or of the thundering clang that caused it, and he is not one to speculate.
- [[Anadea]]
	- Tells party about her cache of notes.
	- Suspects a cult is at the center of these events, but doesn't have all the pieces.
	- Has note from [[Teara-TÃ©ana]], [[Iron Pact]] has info on cult/sinkholeâ€”-but she must come alone ![[GMresource_WrathOfTheWarden-28.webp]]
Be more open with the cool information that is likely to get the players hooked. **A forest god has had its head cut off??** That's creepy and awesome! **[[Anadea]] wants you to investigate a cult** that has infiltrated the city? That's really bad!! Now the players are invested!Â 

Then you have [[Anadea]] contact the players saying she has new and very troubling information, but before she can meet the players the cult gets to her! She is murdered and thrown down the sinkhole! Wow! Now the players have an actual reason to take an interest in their mysterious handler.
