# session notes
[[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] offers to send guards (including [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]], [[Uncle Sam]]) and allows the witches to stay in [[Thistle Hold]] as long as [[The Party]] _only_ reports findings directly to him, and only him. [[The Party]] decides that they can always go back on their word, and accepts the deal.

The witches decide to defend the Hold until [[the party]] gets back. The mayor buys them a room at [[The Winged Ladle]] while the [[Colossi]] are "parked" at the [[Abominatorium]].

[[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] finds a stake with a severed rope tied to it. [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] gets suspicious.

[[The party]] lowers [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] into the [[sinkhole]] to figure out how deep it is, then descends one at a time. It's 208 ft deep.

The group finds the [[Beast Clan]] enclave and [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] finds the [[Lindworm tunnels]] to the north.

A pikeman, [[Gary Pike, Sr. DDS]] trips and falls (it sounds like a pile of pots and pans) and awakens the [[Beast Clan]].
# gm notes
1. It begins to rain
2. [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] has set up a tent to coordinate efforts from the [[sinkhole]]
	1. As [[the party]] approaches, [[malalogai]] (all cloaked up) is seen whispering in his ear.
		1. [[Malalogai]] has compromised priorities and is Nightpitch 's "inside man" on the black cloaks
		2. [[Malalogai]] reports [[Anadea]] is missing and possibly a traitor, suspects her to be an inside man for the [[beast clan]] and possibly a cultist
	2. [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] looks tired, stressed but tries to hide it and feign composure
	3. [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] offers a trade: [[Eferneya]] can stay in the city ifâ€¦
		1. [[The party]] enters the [[sinkhole]] and ONLY reports findings to him
		2. OR if [[the party]] can find out where the [[beast clan]] HQ is
	4. [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] can join [[the party]] as a possible compromise?
3. At the ridge is a rope staked to the ground and severed? torn?
4. The [[sinkhole]] is a sheer cliff face on all sides for about 50m, then opens up into a huge cavern
## At the bottom of the [[sinkhole]]
- It is the [[Underworld]].
- it's clear that there was a cave network connected and the [[beast clan]] warriors scaled the cliff walls near the top to attack
- [[Lindworm]] tunnels connect here too, offer an easy way out but dangerous
