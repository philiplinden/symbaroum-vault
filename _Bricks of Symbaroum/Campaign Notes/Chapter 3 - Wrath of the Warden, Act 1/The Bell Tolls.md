## meanwhile…

[[Kerido]] talked to his uncle on the city watch but did so while wearing a mask to hide his identity. He explained the events of the adventure into the forest and warned of the danger posed by the undead they discovered, the tunnel network, the connection to the family whose codex we recovered, and the loss of a potential ally in the coven of witches b/c we blew up their saint’s remains and tower. [[Kerido]] opened a [[Zweigels]] stand and sponsors [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]]’s expedition and competes for turf with [[Cut-Co Knives]].

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] went on excursions into the forest on monster hunts to improve his place on the leaderboard. He spent a lot of trapping. He found that [[Zweigels]] make good bait.

[[Smellia]] went to the library to learn more about trolls, troll culture, and artifact crafting. There are trolls living in the forest nearby. Forged some relationships with goblins in the area.

[[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] returned to the [[Sun Temple]], but has stayed separated from the clergy. Soul search montage to find what [[Prios]] means to him and how his elvish origins relate to his faith. He also learned basic elvish (25 day streak on [[Lingo-Dua]]).

## now
A commotion interrupts mealtime:

> As soon as the welcoming committee is assembled, the [[North Gate]] opens and [[Captain Marvello]] starts walking. The witches remain still, waiting on the backs of their [[colossi]]. The procession stops a few paces away and [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] turns to his interpreter. If this is one of the player characters, he or she is left to handle the conversation with the witches – [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] seems to understand what is said but is unable to converse in the barbarian tongue.
> 
> The interpreter is ordered to welcome them to the Ambrian realm, whereby one of the witches nods in response and presents himself as [[Gadramon]], sent by [[Yeleta]], the Huldra of [[Karvosti]] (a character with the ability Loremaster knows that one of the Huldra’s closest helpers bears that same name). 
> 
> After that, the interpreter is asked to learn why they have come. [[Gadramon]] responds with a counter-question: “Has the well spoken?” When no one seems to comprehend what the witch refers to, he sternly comments: “No answer is answer enough.” The witch then asks for passage into the town and when asked why he says that they are here to help and that “the Huldra fears that a very potent source of corruption dwells at the heart of [[Thistle Hold]]”. More he cannot say. 
> 
> [[Gadramon]] claims that time is short and when [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] states that he is not able to give them passage without the express permission of [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]], the witch stresses that such permission must be granted right now. In the meantime, he and [[Eferneya]] will return to the forest edge and wait.

[[The Party]] tentatively names themselves _The Bridge_, or _Red Rockets_ (_Team Rocket_ for short).

- [[Smellia]] acts as an interpreter for [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]].
- [[Gadramon]] and [[Eferneya]] warn about the bell.
	- Later, [[Kerido]] covertly approaches them alone and finds more info about how there is corruption and how the bell works.
	- [[Kerido]]’s status with [[Yeleta]] is improved

[[Sinkhole]] emerges!
