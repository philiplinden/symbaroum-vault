[[Brother Hank|Hank]] led [[the party]] into an interrogation chamber in the [[Sun Temple]]'s dungeon. He sent a message (with magic) to [[Malalogai]] to aid in the interrogation.

[[Malalogai]] tortures [[Sibela]] to get information and nearly kills her. She admits to
- [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] is the leader of their dark cult, [[Nocturne Ascendency]]
	- [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] conducting a ritual to gain power
	- The ritual uses the [[Codex Ambreagosa]] to channel magic from [[Eox]] 
- The ritual has already begun. [[Eox]] is dead ([[Death of Eox]])
- [[Sibela]] knows [[Anadea]] and [[the party]] were on their trail, and decided to get rid of them with the ambush ([[Assless Chaps and Kneeless Caps]])
- [[Sibela]] and her brother/friend [[Klagander]] are from [[Old Kadizar]]
- She doesn't actually know all that much. [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] runs the show.
[[The party]] is disappointed by her answers and decides to go down into the [[sinkhole]].
