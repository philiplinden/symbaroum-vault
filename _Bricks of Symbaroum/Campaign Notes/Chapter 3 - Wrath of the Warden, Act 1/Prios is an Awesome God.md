# GM Notes
## Interrogating [[Sibela]]

### What does she want?
Gain power. Become unstoppable. Burn [[Yndaros]] to the ground with everyone inside. Maximum death unto Ambrians. The church is a farce, the Queen is a tyrant, and Ambrians are arrogant bastards. Davokar will inherit the world.

#### Who is she?
[[Klagander]] and [[Sibela]] found each other in [[Old Kadizar]], rejected by their families and forced to steal and sometimes kill to survive. They hate Ambrians and really do not value anything at all besides the dark friendship they share with each other. The only reason why the changelings have joined his [[Nocturne Ascendency]] is because of the dark power promised to them by its leader.

>[!note] [[Sibela]]'s Legal Record
>Year 20. Wanted in relation to a series of robberies and murders with dark overtones in [[Yndaros]]. Known to offer black-market Symbarian artifacts, most of which prove to be trash or counterfeit.

### Why ambush?
- [[Anadea]] was seen by the changeling [[Sibela]] when she made a quick survey of the [[Nocturne Ascendency]]‚Äôs temporary headquarters in a closed-down tannery, prior to meeting with [[The Party]].
- [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] ordered that the woman should be kept under surveillance. And when he later learned of the meeting outside the [[Ordo Tower]] when [[Anadea]] was seen talking to a group of individuals known *as enemies to the [[Nocturne Ascendency]]‚Äì his concerns were multiplied. ([[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] has no idea of how much or how little the characters know, but he will not take any chances.)
- The note was written by [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]], handed [[Sibela]], who in turn gave the task to [[Craigsforth]]. The idea behind the note is of course to lure the player characters into an ambush, thereby quickly disposing of a probable threat or scaring the characters into abandoning their quest.
- Instead of risking the lives and limbs of the cult members, [[Sibela]] gathers a group of rough and desperate fortune hunters at the Rose Garden, and pays them to arrange the ambush in one of the alleys inside Haloban‚Äôs Ring.
### The [[Nocturne Ascendency]]
The [[Nocturne Ascendency]] and its members, as well as the partnership with the mysterious [[The Prince|Prince]], are means to employ in the hunt for power!

They call themselves the [[Nocturne Ascendency]], led by the antique dealer [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] and include the ogre witch [[Manaloum]], the wizard [[Desidera]], the changelings [[Klagander]] and [[Sibela]], and the youngling [[Gardai]], [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]]‚Äôs servant, as members.
#### What is the cult up to?
First, the cult leader has studied and learned the ritual that, according to [[The Prince]], will imbue him with the strength of the Eternal Night. He has also been busy relocating his ritual chamber, down into the [[Underworld]] and to the smooth surface of the [[Crystal Isle]], also this on [[the Prince]]‚Äôs initiative.

## The witches
**Gaining passage into town:** If the players have met with [[Teara-T√©ana]] and repeat her words to Nightpitch, he'll grant permission to smuggle [[Gadramon]] and [[Eferneya]] into town, provided that it is kept secret from all commoners in town.
## Nightpitch
> [!tip] GM note
> The reason why Lasifor is hesitant to let the witches through the palisade is political in nature ‚Äì in part because the residents in town are afraid of witches, in part because the powerful factions of [[Ambria]] want them to be. The fear of the people is important to both [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]] and [[First Father Jeseebegai|Jeseebegai]], since depicting the barbarians as a potential enemy furthers their aims. The First Father even wants the witches of [[Davokar]] to appear as allied to evil, and that image would surely be severely damaged if [[Gadramon]] and [[Eferneya]] were allowed to freely fight abominations on the streets of the Hold. For that very same reason, Nightpitch‚Äôs dear friend Yagaba cannot take part in any public battles against ‚Äúthe Powers of the Eternal Night‚Äù.


- [x] A permit to climb down the [[sinkhole]]. Only possible if the Mayor is a close acquaintance / friend of the characters.
- [ ] Information on the search for the [[Beast Clan]], as described under the header [[The Truth about Haloban]]. This requires that he has good reason to trust and confide in the player characters. Note also that he is not fully convinced that [[Malrek]] is right about the [[Beast Clan]] being the remains of clan Jezora ‚Äì that remains to be proven!
- [ ] The address to Anadeas storage, given the conditions presented in the section Contact with Nightpitch, page 133
- [ ] A letter encouraging all residents of the Hold to be as helpful as possible to its carrier. This letter must be returned at the end of the adventure.
- [ ] Help to convince hesitant agents to join up with the characters in the fight against the cultists, which may be extra welcome if they are trying to form an alliance between, for instance, the [[Iron Pact]] ([[Lysindra Goldengrasp]]) and the [[Sun Church]], or between witches and [[Knights of the Dying Sun|templars]].
- [ ] Inform them of what it takes to get to the [[Halls of a Thousand Tears]] and offer suggestions on how to secure what is needed to find the Halls (see the header The Twin Keys on page 146 for more information).
