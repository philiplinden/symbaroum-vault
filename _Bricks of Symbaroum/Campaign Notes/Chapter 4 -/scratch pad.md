gm calls
- time does not stop for the world or any characters, even if we switch (gta 5 style)
- at the start of every session, invent one fact about the char or something from their backstory
- characters should invent another secret

player preferences
- don’t *avoid* the main quest, but don’t bee-line for it
- continue from level 6 (diff chars ok, respec ok)
