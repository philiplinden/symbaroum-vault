[[Kerido]], [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]], and [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] arrive at [[Thistle Hold]] looking for a new start.
With nowhere else to go, the trio find work from [[Orelia]] in exchange for lodging at [[Salons of Symbaroum]] free of charge.

[[The Party]], now just three, receive their first task: [[ðŸ“œ Find the Codex]].

Of course, [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] doesnâ€™t know where the codex is, so [[The Party]] has to figure that out too.
