The crew went down stairs into the room where [[The Flayer|Alahara]] and Gorak were. Bart has a mental battle with the skull but ratatouilles it to be benign
ja door gets the break link ritual book from the burning building and the crew draws 9 of 9 runes on the ground (in [[The Flayer|Alahara]]â€™s blood). [[The Flayer|Alahara]] dies before starting the ritual chant (bawitdaba). [[Termo]] makes a path through the rubble big enough for a small child. Gorak is almost saved but at the last moment the abomination bursts out of his flesh

notes:
- the skull is draped in underwear (stained) and [[Master Vernam|Vernam]]â€™s cloak
- the building above has collapsed in flame
- [[Baumelo]] was trying to get out, ja door left without helping
