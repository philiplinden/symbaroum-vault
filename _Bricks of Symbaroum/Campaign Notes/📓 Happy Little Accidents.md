The party went down stairs into the room where Alahara and Gorak were. Bart has a mental battle with the skull but ratatoullies it to be benign
ja door gets the break link ritual book from the burning building and the crew draws 9 of 9 runes on the ground (in alaharas blood). alahara dies before starting the ritual chant (bawitdaba). Termo makes a path through the rubble big enough for a small child. gorak is almost saved but at the last moment the abonination bursts out of his flesh

notes:
- the skull is draped in underwear (stained) and vernamâ€™s cloak
- the building above has collapsed in flame
- baumelo was trying to get out, ja door left without helping
