[[The Party]] explores [[Thistle Hold]] looking for clues on where the [[Codex Ambreagosa]] could be.
- On the way to [[Ordo Magica Library|the Library]] of [[Ordo Magica]], [[the party]] runs into [[Ranfalt]].
	- [[Ranfalt]] speaks incoherently about horrors of [[Davokar]] and a [[Blooming Vale]].
	- Trying to understand him, [[Kerido]] offers him some pens and paper.
	- [[Ranfalt]] draws a crude map of the area and circles a region north of [[Melima]] with his own blood. ![[Pasted image 20221229232657.png]]
	- [[The party]] is confused and a bit disturbed, but overall they just feel sorry for him.
	- [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] ‚Äúrelieves‚Äù him of his ‚Äúduty‚Äù of shouting atop his soapbox and begins his own sermon about elves being the true heralds of [[Prios]].
- A scribe at the [[Ordo Magica]] library assist [[the party]] in their research.
	- He discovers a series of maps detailing areas of corruption that roughly coincide with [[Ranfalt]]‚Äôs map.
	- There are other maps where archivists have compiled locations of approximate fault lines and geographies of the area in the time of Symbaroum.
		- Most of [[River Eanor]] exists along these faults
		- The east used to be a shallow sea
	- More maps describe Symbaroum factions that were at war, including Halaran.
		- Halaran‚Äôs citadel sat at the what is now the fork in [[River Eanor]]. It fell into the sea during [[Halaran's Cataclysm]]
