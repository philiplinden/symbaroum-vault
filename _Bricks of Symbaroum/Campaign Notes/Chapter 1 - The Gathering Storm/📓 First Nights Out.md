[[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]], [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]], and [[Kerido]] head north into [[Davokar]].

They are attacked by a surprisingly tenacious rabid racoon.

On the second day, they come across an [[Iron Pact]] warband. [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] tries to interact, but a summer #elf warrior is aggressive and shoos him away.

That night, [[The Party]]â€™s camp is infiltrated by a young spring elf, [[Aida-Eol]], who tries to steal trinkets from [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]]â€™s bag. The elf-child is cornered, reprimanded, and released.
