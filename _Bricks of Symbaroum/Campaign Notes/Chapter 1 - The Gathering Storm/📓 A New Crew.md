- The rumor is that thereâ€™s an *elder sow* with a bounty.
- [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] is not enthused but desperate for work.

[[Smellia]] is looking to further her artifact magic skills and was advised that she might find help from witch covens near [[Melima]].

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] and [[Smellia]] both come across [[The River Maiden]], a trade vessel contracting additional deckhands to deliver goods to [[Melima]].
