[[The Party]] and [[Trobela]] leave the witch coven for [[Lafarda's Tower|Lafardaâ€™s Tower]].

It downpours and thunderclouds loom above the tower.

The [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] explores the first floor and disarms traps placed on the stairs. [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] finds a [[Dragonbone Comb]]. [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] finds a [[Three-Arrows Buckle]].

The copper pole at the center of the tower gets charged up with static as thunder gets louder.

On the second floor, [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] and [[Kerido]] discover the [[Codex Ambreagosa]], which turns out to be a magical pearl ball rather than a book. [[Kerido]] gets shocked by the codex and drops it, nearly breaking it.

[[Smellia]] and [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] stumble upon an [[Etterherd Swarm]] nest on the roof of the tower, but choose not to disturb the swarm.

Lightning strikes the copper rod, numbing the rest of [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]]â€™s left arm.

[[Trobela]] leads the group to the basement where she escaped. There was a dry well that she climbed up, but it looks like it is now filled with water! [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] sees through the illusion and climbs down into the well, having been turned invisible by [[Kerido]].

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] explores the [[Places/Ambria/Thistle Hold/Tunnels Beneath Lafarda's Tower|tunnels beneath Lafardaâ€™s Tower]] and nearly gets found by [[Dragoul]] scouts that are searching the [[Lindworm Tunnels]] for [[Trobela]]. He explores the south end and luckily is still invisible or else he would have been seen by a famished Rage Troll that made camp beneath the tower.

The troll butchers a dead [[Dragoul]] for food.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] rejoins [[The Party]] in the basement of [[Lafarda's Tower]].
