[[The Party]] arrives in [[Melima]]. [[The River Maiden]] docks up and unloads cargo.

[[Vanial-Lo]] stays on the ship since [[Iron Pact]] arenâ€™t welcome in town.

[[The Party]] gets settled at the local tavern and converses with [[Jaro, the Bartender|Jaro]].

[[Aida-Eol]] gets drunk, so [[Smellia|Smellie]] ushers him back to the [[The River Maiden]].
[[Kerido]] is led to the coven of [[Witches of Melima]] by [[Kora]].

[[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] approaches [[Mira]] to discuss [[Gadramei Ilstaler]] while [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] spies from the tavern roof. Nothing fruitful comes from the conversation except that the connection is now established.
[[Mira]] makes a derogatory comment about elves and it sets [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] off. He charges [[Mira]] but she deftly counters and nearly cuts off his ear (claiming that they sell for a good price on the black market). [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] pays her off.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] quietly tails [[Burak O'Bema]] from the tavern to a barn that doubles as a cock-fighting ring and gambling den. He sneaks inside and is confronted by [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]], who admits to being a monster hunter and claims to be hunting the *elder sow* (to [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]]â€™s disappointment).
