[[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] speaks one-on-one with [[Gadramei]].
He calls [[Gadramei]]â€™s bluff and reveals that he is not actually a spy of the Queen, but rather a mercenary hired by [[Tibzibsee]].

[[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] cuts a deal with [[Gadramei]]:
- Let [[Aida-Eol]] go.
- Donâ€™t tell anyone about meeting.
- Maybe work together in the future, such as making deals exchanging intel.
- [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] to meet up with [[Mira]] in [[Melima]].
