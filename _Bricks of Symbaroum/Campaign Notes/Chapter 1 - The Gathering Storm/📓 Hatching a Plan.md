[[Trobela]] shares what she knows about the [[Blooming Vale]], including [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]â€™s army of [[Dragoul]]s.

[[The Party]] cross-references [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]]â€™s map of the [[Lindworm Tunnels]] with [[Trobela]]â€™s recollections, and discovers that the tunnels connect the [[Blooming Vale]] to [[Lafarda's Tower]], plus a meandering path in between.

[[Kerido]] leads [[the party]] back to the witch coven and speaks to [[Kora]] and [[Girind]] about the tower, the [[Codex Ambreagosa]], and the tunnels.

[[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]], [[Kerido]], and [[Smellia]] fear that after the recent [[ðŸ““ Close Calls]], they have no chance of taking on an undead army and/or a [[Lindworm]] and surviving.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] reluctantly agrees, vowing to return for the [[ðŸ“œ Lindworm Hunt]] later on.

[[The Party]] decides the best course of action is to retrieve the [[Codex Ambreagosa]] from the tower and then collapse the [[Lindworm Tunnels]] where they meet [[Lafarda's Tower]].
