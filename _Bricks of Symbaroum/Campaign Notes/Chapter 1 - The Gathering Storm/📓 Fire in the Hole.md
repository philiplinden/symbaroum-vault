[[The Party]] decides to collapse the tunnel to prevent [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]â€™s army from advancing.

[[Kerido]] requests [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] join them at the tower with his explosives.

[[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] goes down the well into the [[Places/Ambria/Thistle Hold/Tunnels Beneath Lafarda's Tower]] and sets all of his explosives, with a long fuse.

[[The Party]] evacuates the tower and waits.

[[Lafarda's Tower]] explodes and collapses. [[AloÃ©na]]â€™s sarcophagus is destroyed. [[Witches of Melima]] are not upset.

[[Vanial-Lo]] and [[Aida-Eol]] disembark from the [[The River Maiden]] and leave for their home enclave. They leave before [[Trobela]] and [[Eran Kalfas|Eran]] discover them.

[[The Party]] transfers [[Eran Kalfas]] to [[The River Maiden]] and set sail down [[River Eanor]] toward [[Thistle Hold]].
