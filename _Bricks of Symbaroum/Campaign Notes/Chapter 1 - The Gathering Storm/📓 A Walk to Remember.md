[[Kerido]] is led to the coven of the [[Witches of Melima]] by [[Kora]].

The local coven leader, [[Girind]], prepares a special tea and incense.

[[Kerido]] drinks the tea and is transported to an *upside down* parallel version of the area.
[[Aroaleta]] herself appears before him and leads him to [[Lafarda's Tower]].

The creek between the coven and the tower is blood. When [[Kerido]] touches the blood, a vision enters his mind, showing the events of [[Life and Undeath of Na-Ethikel]] (through images only)

The vision concludes by revealing the internal layout [[Lafarda's Tower]], and finally ends with a lightning strike to the copper rod at its center.

When [[Kerido]] returns to the material realm, he sees [[Trobela]] fleeing to [[Melima]], chased by three others. He heads back to intercept them in town.
