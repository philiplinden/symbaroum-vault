It starts pouring rain.
[[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] calls out [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]], [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]], [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]], and [[Smellia|Smellie]] in front of the townsfolk.
The crowd begins to sway in favor of [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]].

[[The Party]] attacks [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] but he demonstrates his fighting prowess, honed from years of experience.

[[Trobela]], chased by [[Eran Kalfas]] (possessed) and two [[Dragoul]]s, reaches [[The Party]]. [[Kerido]] intercepts the action as well.

[[The Party]] and [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] put their disagreement on hold and fend off the monsters.
The [[Nightmare]] leaves [[Eran Kalfas|Eran]] and possesses [[Smellia|Smellie]], leaving him mortally wounded and helpless.

[[Trobela]] stabilizes [[Eran Kalfas|Eran]].

[[The Party]] and [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] defeat the [[Dragoul]]s, but canâ€™t shake the [[Nightmare]] from [[Smellia]].

[[Smellia]] resists possession by fighting *Ronald Frump*, an incarnation of everyone she hates, within her mindâ€™s eye. She does not regain control, but she does not allow the [[Nightmare]] to control her body.

[[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] tries to get a cheap-shot on [[The Party]] but surrenders within an inch of death. [[The Party]] spares him in exchange for the information he has about the [[ðŸ“œ Lindworm Hunt]].

[[Trobela]] offers to perform an Exorcism as long as [[The Party]] helps her and [[Eran Kalfas|Eran]].
