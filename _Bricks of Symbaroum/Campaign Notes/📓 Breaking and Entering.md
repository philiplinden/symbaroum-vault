[[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] requests a bunch of iron nails to be fashioned by the local smith, [[Gert]]. She agrees but warns it will take a week or two.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] expresses his suspicions of [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] to [[The Party]], and they hatch a plan to rob him.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]], [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]], [[Smellia]], and [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] arrive at [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]]â€™s tent. They deceive him into thinking [[Mira]] wanted to meet with him at [[Jaro, the Bartender|Jaro]]â€™s tavern. Thinking he might get lucky, [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] gussies up and heads out.

[[The Party]] sneaks into his tent and loots it. They find a map of [[Lindworm Tunnels]] under [[Melima]] and some other goodies. Like any experienced monster hunter, the old man laid traps behind in case this type of thing would happen. A bear trap closes over [[Artek Alzerek|Artek]]â€™s forearms while he digs around in a trunk. Party members heal him up, but heâ€™s left with some nasty scars and gashes in his armor.

The group tries to escape, but when they leave the tent they find themselves surrounded by townsfolk. [[Burak O'Bema|Burak]] approaches, wearing a new wine stain on his shirt and a fiery scowl.
