during the battle, [[Uncle Sam]] fights heroically until facing the [[beast clan]] shaman, who one-shots him. [[The party]] rallies to save him and takes out all of the [[beast clan]].

the only loot is an obsidian dagger, artifact level. it enables the dimension door thing except he opens a bloody wound in the stone walls and goes through, leaving behind no trace except tons of blood

## The [[Crystal Isle]]
If anyone binds to the [[crystal isle]] (same as artifact rules), it reveals many secrets.
1. [[Beast Clan]] made a deal with [[Nocturne Ascendency|Midnight Cult]]: clan promised the cult protection and wayfinding in the forest in exchange for access to [[Thistle Hold]]
2. The ritual the cult is doing requires a place of power, like [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]'s hold.
	1. [[Anadea]] will be used as a sacrifice/vessel for [[Wielda]] (see [[Thus Spoke Aroaleta#Three Forces of the World]])
	2. [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] wishes to conquer death and become immortal
	3. If the ritual completes, the dark wars will start anew and [[Ambria]] will fall as [[Alberetor]] did before it
3. Ancient forbidden magic known by [[iron pact]] elders is the only way to stop it
	1. [[Teara-TÃ©ana]] is who they must seek out
4. [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] is a pawn in a bigger game at play
