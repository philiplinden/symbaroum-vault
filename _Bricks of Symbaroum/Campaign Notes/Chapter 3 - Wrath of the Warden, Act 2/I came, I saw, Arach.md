[[The party]] long rests and explores more of the tunnels to the south. They find a group of [[Arach]] survivors with a subservient Troll artifact crafter named [[Raksadam]] that translates for them. [[The party]] earns good will and a favor by gifting them Purple Sap.

[[Kerido]] hopes to use this relationship as an "early warning system" to bring news from Davokar.

They ascend to a bustle of activity at the [[sinkhole]]'s edge. Nightpitch awaits them smoking a pipe. [[Anadea]] is treated in a tent nearby.

Tell [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]]
- [[Arach]] live below and owe a favor, spiders are peaceful
- [[Beast Clan]] warriors, including the shaman.
	- They are dangerous, capable, and have powerful magic.
	- They seem to be corrupted barbarian folk.
- There are caves that were unexplorable due to a [[Lindworm]] den.

Keep to self
- Details about [[Crystal Isle]]
	- [[Kerido]] has one shard, [[Ganderald]] has the other
	- [[Ganderald]] is told that the Ordo should study the shard secretly from the Mayor. (Secret from party, [[Ganderald]] obliges).

Anadea wakes up.
[[Uncle Sam]] (maybe) recognizes [[Kerido]]. (tie on the deception check).
