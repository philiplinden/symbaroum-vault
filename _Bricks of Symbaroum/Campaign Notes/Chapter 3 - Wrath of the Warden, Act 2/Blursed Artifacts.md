# notes
[[Smellia]] and [[Andor Dawnsinger|Andor]] heal [[Anadea]] to consciousness. [[Anadea]]'s wounds are:
- Lacerations, apparently from blades on her face and arms
- severe trauma to side by liver
- broken tibia
- cracked, broken, bloody nails
- intubated with cartilaginous tube
After reviving her, [[Kerido]] puts her back to sleep with a spell.

[[Artek Alzerek|Artek]] examines the [[Eldershade Dagger]] and notices it was used to make the lacerations. [[Kerido]] magically identifies its properties. [[Smellia]] binds herself to it.

[[Uncle Sam]] carries [[Anadea]] back to the surface.

[[The Party]] explores the [[lindworm]] burrow and comes across its nest. The cave partially collapses as a [[lindworm]] slowly returns to its nest. [[The party]] flees.

[[The party]] discovers a [[Vearon]] and the [[Crystal Isle]]. [[Ganderald]] collects a perfect aquamarine sample crystal. [[Kerido]] takes the [[Crystal Isle Shard]] and casts identify on it to learn its power.

## gm notes

If anyone binds to the [[Crystal Isle Shard]], it reveals many secrets.
1. [[Beast Clan]] made a deal with [[Nocturne Ascendency|Midnight Cult]]: clan promised the cult protection and wayfinding in the forest in exchange for access to [[Thistle Hold]]
2. The ritual the cult is doing requires a place of power, like [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos|Na-Ethikel]]'s hold.
	1. [[Anadea]] will be used as a sacrifice/vessel for [[Wielda]] (see [[Thus Spoke Aroaleta#Three Forces of the World]])
	2. [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] wishes to conquer death and become immortal
	3. If the ritual completes, the dark wars will start anew and [[Ambria]] will fall as [[Alberetor]] did before it
3. Ancient forbidden magic known by [[iron pact]] elders is capable of stopping it
	1. [[Teara-TÃ©ana]] is who they must seek out
4. [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] is a pawn in a bigger game at play
