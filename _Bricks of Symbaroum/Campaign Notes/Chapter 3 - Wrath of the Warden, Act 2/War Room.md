## notes
[[Uncle Sam]] gives [[Kerido]] a handshake. It's unclear if he recognized his nephew or not.

[[The Party]] finds a moment alone with [[Anadea]], who reveals herself as an agent of the [[Iron Pact]]. She confesses to investigating the [[sinkhole]] after having a conversation with [[Teara-TÃ©ana]] (indirectly, through magical means). [[Anadea]] suspects the [[sinkhole]] is connected to the [[Nocturne Ascendency|Midnight Cult]]. She was ambushed, somehow the [[beast clan]] expected her to come. She has a flashback and recalls being used by the clan for a ritual to open a portal to a tannery in [[Blackmoor]].

[[Captain Marvello]] assigned [[Uncle Sam]] on special orders to watch over [[Anadea]] for now.

Nightpitch arranges a private meeting
- [[Thistle Hold]] Township
	- [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]]
	- [[Yagaba]] 
	- [[Ader Gorinder]]
- [[Ordo Magica]]
	- [[Master Eufrynda]] ([[Master Eufrynda|knockers]])
	- [[Kullinan Furia]]
	- [[Ganderald]]
- [[Sun Church]]
	- [[Father Elfeno]]
- [[Queen's Legation]]
	- [[Suria Argona]]
- [[The Party]]

[[Ganderald]] after a while finds evidence that [[Jezora Clan]] and the [[Beast Clan]] are one in the same. He and the ordo find bits and pieces about [[Blood Magic]] and blood gods, and that blood craft relates back to the Ambreagos line and ultimately caused the cataclysm. No traces of Ambreagos lineage from them forward. Records show that [[Erlaber Ambreagos|erlaber]] went by a different name as a boy in [[alberetor]]. Ambreagos name is a recent change.

[[The party]] decides to investigate [[Blackmoor]] for the tannery. They ask the mayor for resources, like intelligence, protection, and a local to show them around town. [[Sarvola Bargomol]] is in [[Blackmoor]], too. (He is a friendly face for [[Anadea]] after her excommunication.)

[[The party]]'s [[Iron Pact Ring]]s become warm as some sort of signal. The witches tell them that this means they are summoned to [[Halls of a Thousand Tears]]. The ritual begins sooner than [[the party]] can rest. Choice: stop it now but weak, or let it complete and seek out from [[iron pact]] to defeat whatever is released with certainty.
