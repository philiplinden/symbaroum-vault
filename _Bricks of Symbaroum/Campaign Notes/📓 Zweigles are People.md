The crew enters the [[Blue Moon]] warehouse and are attacked by a prior victim of [[The Flayer]] (that has been reanimated by the Copper Crown). In combat, the warehouse gets lit on fire and it starts to spread.

[[Captain Marvello]] runs for help from local wizards to put out the fire.

[[Termo]] casts _True Form_ and it reveals that one crate in the warehouse was illusory, obscuring a trap door. [[Baumelo]] races to open the trap door but [[Ja-door Freumage|Ja-door]] knocks him down.

The crew race down the trap door as the building starts to collapse from the fire.
