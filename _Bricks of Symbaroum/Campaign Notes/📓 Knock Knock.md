The [[Termo]], [[Weston Sawyer|Weston]], [[Bartolom]], and [[Niho]] go to the [[Ordo Tower]] to warn them that an imposter may be in their midst.

[[Godalg]], the goblin doorman, let’s them up to see [[Master Eufrynda]].

[[Master Eufrynda|Eufrynda]] explains how *Blood Shrouding* works, and helps the crew discover that [[the flayer]] (disguised as [[Master Vernam|Vernam]]) went to the top floor of [[Ordo Tower]] and took a scroll explaining the *Break Link* ritual.

> **Blood Shrouding** (Sorcery)
The mystic flays a dead person and dresses in its skin, one sliver at a time. After that, the mystic looks exactly like the dead person but has his own voice and his own eyes, which limits its uses. To trick an individual who was acquainted to the diseased and who talks to the mystic, a test against *Discreet←Vigilant* must be made. The effect lasts for 24 hours, then the dead skin falls off.

> **Break Link** (Wizardry)
The mystic can break any current mystical links and bonds to an object or a person by trapping the target in a circle of mystical runes and making a successful Resolute test. The magic of the object is not affected but the target can no longer be reached with rituals like Heretic´s Trail and Summoning. In addition, any mystical bonds that may have been created by people visiting the location are negated, which can be used to prevent others from using Clairvoyance and Seven-league Stride to view or reach the location until they have visited the location again. Finally, Break Link can be used to cut the bond between a creature and a mystical artifact
