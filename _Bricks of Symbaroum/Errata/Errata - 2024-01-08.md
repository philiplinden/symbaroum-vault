As of 2024-01-08 some lore errors, discontinuities, and names have been retroactively changed to maintain continuity. Important (known) facts are added to make up for accidental omissions and other continuity fixes.

1. The [[Nocturne Ascendency|Midnight Cult]] has been renamed to the [[Nocturne Ascendency]].
2. [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] has two key advisors and confidants: witch [[Yagaba]] and Town Seat [[Ader Gorinder]]. 
3. [[Yagaba]] and [[Ader Gorinder|Ader]] tend to advise [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]] to suppress Ambrian expansion and looting of ruins, but so far he has kept a neutral political stance on the matter.
4. [[Queen Korinthia]] and her parents, [[King Ynedar]] (deceased) and [[Queen Mother Abesina]], are members of noble [[House Kohinoor]]. 
5. Legate [[Suria Argona]], head of the [[Queen's Legation]] in [[Thistle Hold]], attends the Mayor's private meeting at [[Nighthome]] to discuss [[The Party]]'s revelations about the [[Sinkhole]].
6. Witch envoys from the Huldra [[Yeleta]], [[Gadramon]] and [[Eferneya]], are permitted to enter [[Thistle Hold]], but their [[Colossi]] are not. The pair has been welcomed by some good-natured farmers near the south gate.
