Folklore is full of tales of other worlds, parallel to the physical world that is the home of the living. Some of these myths also speak of the origin of humankind and there is a worrying pattern to the tales, a pattern indicating that humans stem from somewhere else; stuff of legend which has been granted support by the enormous stone ships found stranded in the far east, beyond the Ravens and the desert where a human empire â€“ sometimes talked about as the First Empire â€“ is said to have blossomed and died. From whence the humans once came to this world is not known, but the existence of other worlds is more or less an established fact, at least among scholars.

For mystics and others studying the subject there is no doubt that this world is only one of many. There have been attempts to establish a verifiable classification and one of the most talked about is [[Katrandama]]â€™s Triptych, named after a sorcerer who was burned to death in Kadizar in approximately year â€“24. [[Katrandama]] left notes and drawings behind regarding the composition of the world.

Before her, most mystics believed the cosmos to be divided in two: the world of the living, and an un-world inhabited by spirits and abominations. [[Katrandama]] crushed this dichotomous worldview and imagined that the worlds fitted together as the pieces of a three-part altarpiece, with the physical world in the middle and the wings made up of the Spirit World and the [[Yonderworld]]. Normally, the triptych is closed and all beings are caught within its frames, but aided by the powers of sorcery the wings can be pushed ajar and the gaps used as pathways between the worlds. Some speculate that the corruption amassing in the world makes the triptych tremble and occasionally open up, making it possible for undead and abominations to enter where gaps occur.

According to the teachings of [[Katrandama]], mystical rituals can also be understood in light of the three worlds. From the physical world comes the building blocks of both flaming servants and the undead raised by Necromancers, but it also requires control over the Spirit World â€“ the grey, barren land of ashes and lost spirits that borders Eternity, where no one alive may travel. Only spirits can enter the infinite void, after which not even they may return. The restless spirits and ghosts that spiritualists speak to and necromancers bend to their will travel the Spirit World. It takes the power of a god to send spirits back from the Eternity beyond the Spirit Worldâ€™s borderland, just as [[Prios]] sends Patron Saints to his most loyal servants.

The [[Yonderworld]] is thought to be a mist-shrouded wasteland, possible to mistake for the Spirit World, yet vastly different: its nature is corruption. Its fauna consists of abominations, from small Blight Spawns to ancient Blight Beasts of immense power. As stated by [[Katrandama]], the [[Yonderworld]] is the world from which humankind fled to this one â€“ an idea that very few mystics are prepared to accept and the Curia has deemed to be contentious and heretical; the humans came over the eastern sea from another continent, fleeing from idol worshippers and sun haters â€“ at least according to the official stands of the [[Sun Church]].
