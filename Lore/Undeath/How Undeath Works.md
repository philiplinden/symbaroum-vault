[[Life and Undeath of Na-Ethikel]] explains the first known appearance of undead revenants. One faction invested in *creation of life* through undeath. The opposing faction invested in *preservation of life* through undeath.

In the [[Yonderworld]], undead creature become living and living creatures become undead.

In Symbaroum, undeath is typically linked with corruption, as the energy that animates undead is inherently tainted by dark magic. However, there are cases where undeath can be a side effect of desperate or unorthodox methods to preserve life or accomplish some greater good. Here’s how a character with good intentions might end up as an undead without falling into the depths of corruption.

1. Alchemical or Herbal Influence

In Symbaroum, the witches of [[Davokar]] and certain alchemists use potent rituals and substances from the dark forest. This adventurer might have ingested or been exposed to a concoction that stopped their decay post-mortem, effectively rendering them undead. Perhaps they were dying of injuries or disease, and a trusted companion or healer tried an experimental brew to save them—one that ended up preserving their soul and animating their body beyond death. This might have been a one-time brew made with rare plants like Mandrake Root or Mortbloom that halted corruption from progressing fully, anchoring them to the mortal realm.

2. Ancient Rituals and Relics

There are relics and ancient rites from Symbaroum’s lost civilization, the [[Symbar]], which can animate a corpse without inherently corrupting it, though it’s always risky. Perhaps your adventurer discovered or was given a relic—say, a pendant or ring—that grants unnatural vitality. The relic could have activated upon their death, keeping their body animated as a vessel for their will. In this case, the adventurer remains undead due to the relic’s influence, which could be more benign in nature but with unintended consequences.

1. [[Benevolent Necromancy]]

While [[Lore/Magic/Necromancy|necromancy]] is taboo, it’s possible a sympathetic sorcerer revived this adventurer for a noble reason. A pact with a nature spirit or minor deity might have kept them free from corruption, allowing the adventurer’s essence to linger without taint. This sort of “[[Benevolent Necromancy|white necromancy]]” would be rare, but if the intent was pure and the ritual precise, it could animate the adventurer without fully corrupting them. They’d be undead but motivated by their original purpose rather than decay or malicious spirits. ^bkag2v

2. The Queen's Miracle or Another Divine Power

The Ambrian queen, who is rumored to have great knowledge of healing and restoration arts, could be involved here. If the adventurer was close to death in [[Ambria]], perhaps their allies brought them to someone who could petition her aid. The queen or her clergy may have used a powerful ritual to hold off true death but couldn’t entirely reverse it. Another possibility is intervention from the [[Prios|Sun God]] [[Prios]], allowing them to remain animated to serve a righteous purpose but making them undead in the process.

Summary

In Symbaroum, undeath without full corruption can be explained through alchemical influence, ancient relics, [[benevolent necromancy]], or divine intervention. This would leave your adventurer in a state where they are technically undead but retain their autonomy and original intentions—just a bit paler and with a potentially creepy vibe. This approach aligns well with Symbaroum’s themes of darkness and the thin line between corruption and purity.
