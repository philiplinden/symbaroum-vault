Unlike the [[Odaiova Clan|Odavs]], the warmongering Karits are distrustful, if not hostile, towards the new lords of the realm. This can probably be explained by the fact that Ambrian treasure-hunters have invaded their territory during the past decades, scaring game away and attracting elves. Or could it possibly have something to do with what happened to the former ally of [[Karohar]] â€“ [[Haloban]] and his [[Jezora Clan|Jezites]]? Regardless, the territory of the Karits is far from safe.

Members of this clan are referred to as *Kerits*.
