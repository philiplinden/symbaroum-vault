The cult of nobles known as The Sacred of the Old Blood operates in obscurity. Lead by [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]]’s stepfather, [[Sesario Karnak]], and her half-sister [[Esmerelda]], the group seeks to harness the dark powers of Davokar for two specific reasons:

1. ennobling the already noble blood of [[Ambria]], and
2. bringing the undead [[Queen Mother Abesina]] back to actual life.

To achieve this, they recruit nobles from all corners of the kingdom and convince them that noble blood can never be corrupted; mildly tainted at worst, and only if one’s blood is not noble enough.
