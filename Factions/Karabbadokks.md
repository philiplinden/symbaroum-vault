Most tribespeople from this goblin clan are subjected to indentured servitude in [[Thistle Hold]]. At night, the tribe cleans the whole city. They also are used as labor for public works projects.

The tribeâ€™s settlement, Krabbadokks, is to the east of [[Thistle Hold]], out of sight from the city walls.
