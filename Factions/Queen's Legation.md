The administrative/executive arm of the crown. While mostly autonomous, the legation is subject to direct control by [[Queen Korinthia]]. The rest of the time, the legation enforces imperial laws and regulations.

Most day-to-day activities remain administrative, but the legation does maintain squads of Legionnaires with advanced weaponry in forward operating bases of large settlements.!
