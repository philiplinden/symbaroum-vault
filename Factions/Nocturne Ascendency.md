Wrath of the Warden is about what happens when
one such cult is lured (or tricked) into contributing
to exploring the darkness of the world. They
call themselves the Midnight Cult, led by the
antique dealer [[Erlaber Ambreagos]] and include the ogre witch
[[Manaloum]], the wizard [[Desidera]], the changelings
[[Klagander]] and [[Sibela]], and the youngling [[Gardai]],
[[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]]’s servant, as members. Aside from [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]],
the cult members are described in the scenes in
act 3 where the player characters are likely to face
them (pages 163–164).
