## Year 10
- [[Jezites' Downfall]]

## Year 21
- [[The Truth about Haloban]]: 
	- "When the Ambrians attacked the Jezites in year 10, a large part of the clan members fled down into the natural caves below [[Haloban]]'s fortress, and the camouflaged passage down was never found by [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]]â€™s troops. The remaining Jezites have lived down there ever since, continuously affected by the nurturing but also corrupting power of the black bedrock."
