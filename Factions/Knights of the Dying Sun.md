# Core Beliefs
- It was [[Prios]] who saved the people from the [[Dark Lords]]. The brothers and many of their companions believe it to be an insult to the [[Prios|Lawgiver]] that [[Ambria]] is still governed by a human monarch. [[Prios]] should rule, through a more actionable and righteous First Father than the current one.
