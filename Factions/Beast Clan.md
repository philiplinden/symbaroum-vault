This clan is composed of the remnants of the [[Jezora Clan|Jezite]]s that escaped the events of [[Jezites' Downfall]]. The survivors isolated themselves and took shelter in the caves beneath [[Thistle Hold]]. In addition to the isolation, the caves and hollows that the survivors used for shelter were steeped in corruption.

Over the years, the faith and customs of the clan became increasingly violent and veered heavily into [[Fleshcraft]] and [[Blood Magic]].
