The Iron Pact is run from a secret location in the [[Underworld]] called the [[Halls of a Thousand Tears]], the only permanent Elven settlement in [[Davokar]]. For centuries they only had the clans and some single, spontaneously awakened abominations to worry about. But with the arrival of the Ambrians they are up against a superior power that does not realize the gravity of the problems it causes, for themselves and others. Faced with this threat, the leaders of the pact have reacted in different ways. The most peaceable ones claim that their only chance is to help the Ambrians understand; others stress that the battle is already lost and aim to cause the enemy as much harm as possible before the end.

Leaders:
- [[Eneáno]]
- [[Mearoel]]
- [[Teara-Téana]]

Agents:
- [[Lysindra Goldengrasp]]
- [[Anadea]]

Aside from the continuous interference with the Hold’s trade in Symbarian artifacts [[Mearoel]] has two main goals. First, they aim to burn the town to the ground, something they have already started to prepare by hiding barrels of flammable liquids in the district surrounding the [[Queen's Square|Queen’s Square]]. When that has been accomplished, they need the Iron Pact to agree on a more aggressive strategy – together with human collaborators in the border region, the elves and their allies could gain information about and stop all expeditions journeying out into the woods. And if that would make the Queen send her army into [[Davokar]], then maybe also the clans could be persuaded to rally behind the High Chieftain and engage in the battle.

All whose actions might awaken [[Wratha]] – those who through their actions bring about severe Corruption, whether locally or regionally, temporarily or permanently – are considered enemies of the Iron Pact.
