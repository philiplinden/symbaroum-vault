[[Throne of Thorns 3 - Darkest Star]], page 28

>Though [[Yndaros]] is formally run from the [[Herakleo Attio|Key Master]] Seat, it is common knowledge that [[Herakleo Attio]] and his colleagues are working in the Queen’s shadow – at the end of the day, everything they do requires [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]]’s implicit or explicit approval. It would therefore be unfair to blame the [[Herakleo Attio|Key Master]] for the increasingly harsh rhetoric and measures used against displeasing elements.
>
>[[Herakleo Attio|Herakleo]] oversees and coordinates the administration at the [[Herakleo Attio|Key Master]] Seat, but all major decisions are made in consultation with the leaders of its other branches, or at the top – by the Queen and her council. As First Justice, [[Father Matheo Brigo]] has a place on both the city’s and the Queen’s council; they say that he often sends one of his subordinate Judges to attend the Seat’s meetings, but the honorable sun priest must still be described as one of [[Yndaros]]’ most powerful individuals – especially since he is the one who records and communicates the laws of [[Prios]].
>
>The other council members are Tax Commissioner Eudora Garlaka and Construction Commissioner Jurlio Berakka, both of whom run vast organizations with many branches and sub-departments. The Tax Commissioner is personally responsible for the city’s finances, while her underlings manage day-to-day activities such as payments, disbursements, debt collection, audits and so on. Master Jurlio’s subordinates are in turn responsible for sanitation, construction, renovation, roads and parks (including monuments and such).
>
>Persistent rumors suggest that the seasoned Construction Commissioner, Duke Junio’s father, who by the end of the war held an equivalent position in Kandoria, is often at odds with the much younger, lowborn, yet completely disrespectful Eudora. Naturally, the issue causing the arguments is whether the Tax Commissioner allocates enough funds for construction and maintenance, which – as Master Jurlio sees it – she does not. And the general population are equally divided. On the Construction Commissioner’s side are the people living in the city’s eastern districts, with rugged streets, unreliable wells, inadequate drainage systems, and no barrier between them and the diseased and desperate wretches at the refugee camp. Most other citizens would like to stay on the current path, with more money being spent on the City Watch, the prisons, and other security measures.
>
>Some astute observers are sometimes heard wondering whether the need for guards and prisons would not decrease drastically if only the lives of refugees, daythalers and common laborers were made a little bit easier.
