Defected from [[Ilanda]]’s party before their demise, stealing [[Ilanda's journal|Ilanda’s journal]] as he escaped.

Fled to [[Jakaar]] and gained passage on [[The River Maiden]] to “look for his missing colleague, [[Ilanda]]” under the guise of a researcher. His actual intent was to find [[Ilanda]] (who he presumed to be dead) and loot their camp.

He was last seen on the south bank of [[River Eanor]] across from [[Kalea-Ma Har Cemetery]], having been abandoned there during [[📓 Beach Episode - Part 3]].
