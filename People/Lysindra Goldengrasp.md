_Former fortune hunter, merciless fighter_

Member of the [[Iron Pact]]

The experiences of the former treasure hunter Lysindra Goldengrasp have led her to the conclusion that the elves and the witches are correct – the woods must be left in peace or else [[Ambria]] will end up as the realm of the [[Dark Lords]]. She does not trust [[Queen Korinthia|Korinthia]] or anyone else to be able to accept the truth, and she is prepared to do anything in her power to sabotage the projects of both treasure hunters and explorers. To aid her she has the autumn elf [[Mearoel]] and a group carefully chosen, previous explorer colleagues that have reached the same conclusion. The elf and the human agents are hidden in a warehouse close to the palisade where she used to store her exploration gear.

> The aggressive branch of the [[Iron Pact]] which is led by the former treasure hunter Lysindra Goldengrasp has no idea about what has happened to [[Eox]] or that the skull is hidden inside the palisade. However, the autumn elf [[Mearoel]] knows the truth about the “well”, so right from the start the group will be on the hunt for the source of corruption that the device warned of – though without any success, since the skull is concealed with mystical veils.

### Ulterior Motives
Aside from the continuous interference with the Hold’s trade in Symbarian artifacts, Lysindra and [[Mearoel]] have two main goals. First, they aim to burn the town to the ground, something they have already started to prepare by hiding barrels of flammable liquids in the district surrounding the [[Queen's Square|Queen’s Square]]. When that has been accomplished, they need the [[Iron Pact]] to agree on a more aggressive strategy – together with human collaborators in the border region, the elves and their allies could gain information about and stop all expeditions journeying out into the woods. And if that would make the Queen send her army into [[Davokar]], then maybe also the clans could be persuaded to rally behind the High Chieftain and engage in the battle.

### Beef with TT
When [[Teara-Téana]] hears the name Lysindra Goldengrasp she involuntarily flinches and her face darkens. Her gaze wanders between the characters for a while, after which she states that the conversation is over and that they have to leave the halls forthwith, willingly or with an escort. The characters have one chance to explain that they are not in league with Lysindra but that she forced them to take her along. For her part, Lysindra demands that she must be allowed to stay since she is a full member of the [[Iron Pact]], but that is not reason enough for [[Teara-Téana]]. It ends with a very grumpy Goldengrasp being shoved through one of the corridors by ten spear-carrying summer elves. Of course, the reason for this is that [[Teara-Téana]] distrust [[Mearoel]] and other aggressive members of the pact, worried that their actions will provoke the humans into intensifying the effort to cultivate/exploit the Forest of [[Davokar]].
