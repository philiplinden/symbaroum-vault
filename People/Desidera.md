> This deviates from [[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden]]. As written, Desidera is [[Erlaber Ambreagos]]'s lover and a human wizard of [[Ordo Magica]].

Cultist assassin with magic aptitude. Member of [[Nocturne Ascendency]].
Was a wizard-in-training at [[Ordo Magica]] until [[Master Eufrynda|Knockers]] kicked her out.
The reason given for her expulsion was repeated insubordination and violation of Ordo Code of Conduct. 
	- caught multiple times trying to pilfer scrolls and tomes from the restricted section of the [[Ordo Magica Library]]
	- often "went too far" during mock exercises and trainings with other wizards. On more than one occasion, this resulted in major injuries to other students.
	- The last straw was when another student, [[Ranfalt]], went mad as a result of Desidera's loose control and thirst for power when she attempted a version of _Magic Circle_ that allows teleportation, which required a forbidden and evil form of magic.

Desidera's malice comes from resentment toward the [[Ordo Magica]] for "holding her back" and, as she believes it, trying to gaslight her into thinking she was less capable than she is. She wants nothing more than to prove them wrong.

[[Erlaber Ambreagos]] recruited Desidera after her expulsion on account of needing teleportation magic. He feeds her lust for powerful magics and supplies her with tools to practice and learn powerful spells like _Invisibility_ and _Anathema_
