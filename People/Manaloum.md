Manaloum grew up as the adoptive son of a childless witch of Clan Enoai, far to the north. He did his best to live up to the high demands and expectations of his mother, but never got anything but reprimands and deep sighs in return.

His frustration grew into desperation and finally he started breaking the clan’s taboos in order to grow stronger. And sure, the roots of the herb Runefala have helped him. They helped him to overcome and slay his stepmother when she discovered what he was up to, and they have helped him realize that the price of success must be paid for in Corruption…

**Tactics:** Manaloum first uses scorching ray, firebolt, or
magic missile. He has consumed a runefala root and cast mage
armor before the encounter begins. He will try to deal with
enemy mystics by using counterspell and banishment. He only
enters into close combat if it is impossible to avoid it.
