Elori is an elf Envoy residing in [[Yndaros]].

The task of negotiating with [[Queen Korinthia]] has ever since her arrival belonged to a towering elf named Elori. Before the migration, the Ambrians had never had contact with the elven kind, and the unwillingness of the forest people to let them explore [[Davokar]] has made them detest the “pointy-ears” as intensely as they hate rage trolls. Elori himself seems to appreciate the situation. He is seldom seen on the streets of [[Yndaros]], and when it happens he is always on his way to or from the royal palace, escorted by royal guards.

It is said that Elori has come to [[Yndaros]] in search of a peaceful solution to the conflicts between men and elves, but no one doubts that he primarily has been sent to spy. This belief was greatly strengthened the other year when he had a visitor – namely [[Aloéna]], the giant she-being who otherwise resides in a grove on the cliff of [[Places/Davokar/Karvosti]]. What was said between them is not to be known, but since then Elori is sighted more often. The taunts and objects thrown at him bother him as little as ever before.

Naturally, no one dares lay a hand on Elori and his aides, as he is clearly on good terms with the [[Queen Korinthia|Queen of Ambria]].

Rumors abound of Elori's ties to the [[Iron Pact]].
