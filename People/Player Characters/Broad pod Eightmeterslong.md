A towering 7'8" Ogre witch, wearing well kept layered smooth fabrics, and carrying a pack full of scrolls. He showed up soon after undead attack, and was introduced and recommended to the group by [[Khargon Tarzibczie|Khargon]] - their shared past is still not entirely clear yet. He has spent his recent weeks learning about [[Thistle Hold]], its people, culture, religion and and mystic knowledge he can get a hold of. Not much is known of his past and his time with the witches yet, and as you'd imagine it takes some time for the townspeople to warm up to him, but he has now established some friends and acquaintances.
