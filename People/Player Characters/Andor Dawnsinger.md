Trained as a [[Knights of the Dying Sun|Templar]] until he showed signs of being a changeling.
Although he was shunned from the Church for his origins, Andor is a zealot of [[Prios]]â€”except he believes elves are the true heralds of His power, not humans.

Andor has lived in [[Thistle Hold]] since it was constructed. He idolizes elves and is curious about the [[Iron Pact]].
