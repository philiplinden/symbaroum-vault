You were exchanged for your parents’ firstborn in a barbarian settlement, and from there it only got worse. “Mother” and “Father” had you work as an apprentice of the village tanner and sent you away as soon as your heritage became apparent. Since then you have learned to manage on your own, but you have always wondered why your elven kin gave you up.

You have traveled the countryside of [[Ambria]] hoping to find answers, or at least some other outcasts to form some sort of communion with. If all else fails you have heard of a human named [[People/Master Vernam|Vernam]], who lives in [[Thistle Hold]] and is said to know much about elves.  

You may have ended up south of the mountains for various reasons, but most likely as the traveling companion of Rageor, Magdala or Fenya. If you have any friends it is because they are outsiders or because they may have knowledge about the elves that once abandoned you to the humans.

### personal goal
To become top salesperson of the year for [[Cut-Co Knives]] to earn a bonus that will fund my search for my lost family, either a professional investigator or time for me to just not work and travel
