Thin, pointed mustache and goatee.  
Slightly sunken eyes- doesn't see enough sun.  
Slicked back black hair.  
Bright green eyes. The one feature that is at all charming.  
Thin and long proportioned limbs. Changeling-like

Orphan urchin child. Grew up farther south in a town smaller than [[Thistle Hold]] but but a country village. Sustained some deforming injury at that time. (DEFORMED SHOULDER)  
Through cunning and less-than-noble methods, he improved his station. Still living on the streets but through a combination of working hard and lying/forging (ROGUE-ISH), he hopped around varied but steadily improving jobs. Starting in begging, manual labor, running errands, stocking shelves, clerking, eventually ending up at a book store. Taught to read, other topics, and eventually did accounting for the shop. (INTELLIGENT) Catching the eye of some [[Queen's Rangers]] (they observed his behavior/poise/sleight of hand in the shop and then followed him to the streets- saw how he lived in a self-constructed and well disguised warren of what looked like discarded crates/boxes in an alley; they saw his thieving too). They employed his talents in some work they were doing to root out a criminal in the thieves guild. Then he was brought to the Rangers academy in (capital) where he was trained and educated further. (I'M NOT SURE WHAT LEVEL OF INTERACTION HE HAS WITH THESE TWO RANGERS AFTER THEY BROUGHT HIM IN. BUT HE TRUSTS THEM AND MAYBE THAT IS MISPLACED TRUST?)  
Stationed in [[Thistle Hold]] to monitor the denizens, both common and those in positions of power. Part of an office/network. He is not alone in this and doesn't know everyone else. (COULD BE RELEVANT) Cover is an accountant in the tax dept. Has one boss and knows a couple other agents. (SO 3X CONTACTS IN RANGERS INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN THISTLEHOLD. KNOWS SOME OTHER NON-SPY GOV'T OFFICIALS TOO. MAYBE SOME NON-SPY WORK RIVALRIES TOO.) Main topic recetly is monitoring the interactions between Ambrians and Barbarians- looking for anything changing related to the [[Iron Pact]]. Always looking to avoid surprises, prevent disadvantages for Ambrian vs Barb./[[Iron Pact]], and where possible, gain advantages over those factions for later use.

Personal Goal: Enter noble class, live comfortably (if always still working/scheming) in the Capital.

Motivations: Constant self advancement.  
Protection of the Ambrian system he's advancing in.

Loyalties: Self.  
The Queen's gov't collectively but no individual.  
Ambrian society's hierarchy.Â 

Loves: Good penmanship

Hates: The cold and damp of [[Thistle Hold]]  
Street urchins

Manner: Prim, overly protective of what he considers to be proper decorum and Ambrian social manners/mores. Always working to improve his station. There is a little bit of a hunch in his shoulder from an injury sustained as an urchin child on the streets of some small town.

Faction/Family/Clan/Tribe: [[Queen's Rangers]], Ambrian intelligence community, self-loyal

Reputation: wormy, clever, unassailable. One of those managers with no direct reportees. Annoyingly effective at his job.
