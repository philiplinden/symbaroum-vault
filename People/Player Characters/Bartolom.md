You are a novice in [[Ordo Magica]], [[Ambria]]’s biggest and most influential order of wizardry. When all others journeyed north you and your master stayed in [[Alberetor]] to study the dying earth, although you wanted nothing more than to tag along in search for the truth behind rumors about [[Davokar]]’s herbs and the magic of barbarian witches.

Now that your master is dead it is time to put that plan into action. The first step is to locate your old colleague, [[People/Master Vernam]] who is said to live in [[Thistle Hold]]. The last thing your departed master asked of you was to bring the one true treasure of your tower to [[Grand Master Seldonio]] in [[Yndaros]] – the ancient artifact known as the [[Sun Stone]]. Once this is done you are free to do whatever you like, but you probably contemplate joining the chapter in [[Thistle Hold]].
