Ja-door Freumage (pronounced *J'adore fromage*) 

Ja-door is an undead Wizard who has been long been part of the [[Ordo Magica]]. He doesn't remember how long he has been alive, or when he turned undead. But its been 187 years since he realized that he had forgotten either measure and started to keep track of the days again. He has much of his past stuck in a tomb, and remembers little of this past. He was discovered by an expedition of the [[Sun Church]] and after an initial altercation, was eventually brought back to civilization by the expedition at the cost of dealings he has forced to keep secret. It was sometime after this episode that he decided to first take up cooking, and then take up wizardry. After an initial start as a self-taught mystic, he eventually joined the [[Ordo Magica]] and became a full-blown wizard.

Ja-door originally died because he was buried alive by mistake.

During [[ðŸ““ The Last Stand]], Ja-door was possessed by the spirit of [[Hurian's Skull]] after it was destroyed.

Ja-door is uniquely adept at aging cheese.
