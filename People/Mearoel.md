High ranking member of the [[Iron Pact]]. Subordinate to [[EneÃ¡no]].

[[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden|Wrath of the Warden]], page 143-144
> Mearoel is one of the many [[Iron Pact]] members who has given up hope on the Ambrians. The barbarians managed to uphold some kind of balance, but the hunger of the newcomers threatens to drag all of them into perdition. All that Mearoel and his allies can hope for is to hamper the wrongdoers and postpone the inevitable as far into the future as possible. Not in the hope of triumphing or to enact revenge, but out of the aspiration to honor the power that breeds life.
