Ganderald, an adept of [[Ordo Magica]], is a changeling, born among the elves of [[Davokar]] but fostered by the members of clan [[Karohar 1]] near the forest edge. Like the majority of his kinsmen, he left his human family when his adoptive parents passed away. After having roamed the Ambrian countryside for years, he happened to end up in [[Yndaros]] as [[Ordo Magica]] held its “annual tryouts”, when anyone may perform the Order’s test of admission. He passed with flying colors and has in two years risen to the rank of adept.

Today Ganderald works for [[Master Goncai]] and shares his ambition to study and understand the Elder Folks, particularly the elves. Ganderald’s special project involves the mapping of all observations made of elven activities, in the hope of uncovering where they might have their villages, cities or meeting places. At the moment he is focusing on two locations, both situated far beyond the border of [[Davokar]], and he is trying to convince the Chapter Master that they are worth a closer look. When he succeeds he will be in need of capable traveling companions.
