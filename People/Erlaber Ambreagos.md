## motivation
Erlaber holds onto a childlike resentment of [[Ambria]] from the war. He thinks that the Ambrian army didn't give a shit about his family and let them die. He saw [[Dark Lords]] bring back from the dead and that got him on the quest. He has been carried away on revenge and lust for power under the influence of [[The Prince]], who has brainwashed him into doing this, when if you take a step back he is better off aiding in the quest to understand undeath.  ^2114cb

## canon backstory
[[Throne of Thorns 1 - Wrath of the Warden|Wrath of the Warden]], p. 81
> Erlaber is the sole survivor of a lesser but still noble house who ruled a barony bordering the realm of the [[Dark Lords]]. His father, Baron Oramei Haaras, saw the enemy mount in strength and eventually began to study the practices which gave them such power. When the attack came, Oramei immediately surrendered and was welcomed into the dark fellowship of the Lords. But when that happened, the six-year old Erlaber had already been forced to leave the residence, by his older brother Herek. They barely survived the war as nameless vagabonds; Erlaber’s hate for his brother and admiration for his father growing with each passing day.
> 
> Up until the death of his brother five years ago, Erlaber made an effort to hide his blackened soul. Together they built a successful business trading in items salvaged from old [[Alberetor]] and both of them had families. But when Herek drank himself to death, the darkness of the younger brother bloomed. He sold the business for a good profit and moved his chastened family to [[Thistle Hold]], to get closer to [[Davokar]]. He was bent on succeeding where his father had failed – to ally with the dark and gain strength enough to establish a brand new house of power, named after an ancient Symbarian bloodline: Ambreagos. The [[Nocturne Ascendency]] and its members, as well as the partnership with the mysterious [[The Prince]], serves the same purpose as the blood he harvested from his wife and children: they are means to employ in the hunt for power!
