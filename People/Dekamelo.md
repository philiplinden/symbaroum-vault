One of several captains of [[Thistle Hold]]'s [[Town Watch]] and confidant to [[Queen Korinthia]]

Formerly named, Akman Kohinoor. Became orphaned as his father,
Korinthia’s cousin, and the rest of the family were attacked
by robbers when crossing the Titans. He and a group of well-paid
companions in the Town Watch act as the faction’s extended
arm when something needs to be dealt with.
