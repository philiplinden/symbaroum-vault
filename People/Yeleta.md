The current *Huldra* (leader of witches) residing alongside the High Chieftain in [[Places/Davokar/Karvosti]].

Witches have significant influence over barbarian peoples, including the High Chieftain and other clan chiefs. Some claim that Yeleta has a greater hold over her people than the Queen has over the Ambrians.
