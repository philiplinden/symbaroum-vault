Mayor of [[Thistle Hold]].

There is probably no one living in [[Thistle Hold]] who has not heard the story of how Lasifor Nightpitch delivered an armful of Twilight Thistles to the court in [[Yndaros]], how he instructed the medicus of the gravely ill Queen Mother in how to prepare and use it, and later paid for the construction of [[Thistle Hold]] with the reward gained from his heroic act.
