> The interpreter is ordered to welcome them to the Ambrian realm, whereby one of the witches nods in response and presents himself as Gadramon, sent by [[Yeleta]], the Huldra of [[Karvosti]] (a character with the ability Loremaster knows that one of the Huldra’s closest helpers bears that same name). After that, the interpreter is asked to learn why they have come. Gadramon responds with a counter-question: “Has the well spoken?” When no one seems to comprehend what the witch refers to, he sternly comments: “No answer is answer enough.”

> The witch then asks for passage into the town and when asked why he says that they are here to help and that ”the Huldra fears that a very potent source of corruption dwells at the heart of [[Thistle Hold]]”. More he cannot say. Gadramon claims that time is short and when [[Captain Marvello|Marvello]] states that he is not able to give them passage without the express permission of [[Lasifor Nightpitch|Mayor Nightpitch]], the witch stresses that such permission must be granted right now. In the meantime, he and [[Eferneya]] will return to the forest edge and wait.


For every piece of information regarding the situation in town offered by the characters, Gadramon agrees to answer a question. This is what he has to tell:
- Three days prior to their arrival at [[Thistle Hold]], the Huldra had a dreamsight. She woke up raving: *“… a dying god will bring forth the black …”*; *“… the night drowns the plunderers’ town”*; *“… not exaltation, a fall, deep down into the Abyss …”*
- “*The plunderers’ town*” is what many barbarians call the Hold, and the word “god” has a different meaning among barbarians than among Ambrians – a better translation might be “spirit” or “forest warden”.
- The Bronze Well on the Antique Plaza is an ancient device, activated when powerful sources of corruption come close. That (or if, depending on when the characters meet with the witches) it sounded is evidence supporting [[Yeleta]]’s dreamsight.
- This source of corruption must be found and neutralized – it is deadly in itself and can in the wrong hands be used for horrible deeds. If everything in the Huldra’s dream corresponds to the factual situation, the power may be used to give birth to a very potent abomination.
