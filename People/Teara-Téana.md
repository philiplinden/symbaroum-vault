Autumn elf and high ranking member of the [[Iron Pact]].

[[@Throne1.ThistleHoldWrath]], p82
>The autumn elf Teara-Téana counts among the more tempered members of the [[Iron Pact]]. She has reached the conclusion that the only chance there is to live up to the aim of the pact, *“Nevermore!”*, is to convince the Ambrians of the dangers in violating the world at large, and [[Davokar]] in particular. She is also one of the elves who have assumed the responsibility of caring for the spirits roaming the region, among them the mighty [[Eox]].
