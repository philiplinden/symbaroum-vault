Wizard of [[Ordo Magica]].
![[Pasted image 20230728205603.png]]
- Kullinan may be the most single-minded of all masters of [[Ordo Magica]]. 
- He is hundreds of years old and 
	- did not take part in the war against the [[Dark Lords]], with the argument that 
	- he had more important things to do – namely, to study the war prisoners captured and try to learn what kind of mystical powers controlled their will. 
- Understanding the world is all that counts; affecting the world or its creatures are not his interests – “_insight before intervention, knowledge before knowhow_,” is a motto his adepts hear again and again.
- The last baron of house Furia.
