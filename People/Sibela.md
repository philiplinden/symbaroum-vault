The friends [[Klagander]] and Sibela were two of the first changelings to be discovered among the Ambrians, both of them in [[Yndaros]], with Sibela amongst the refugees and [[Klagander]] in a merchantâ€™s home.

They found each other in [[Old Kadizar]], rejected by their families and forced to steal and sometimes
kill to survive. They hate Ambrians and really do not value anything at all besides the dark friendship they share with each other. [[Erlaber Ambreagos|Erlaber]] helps them to grow stronger, which is the only reason why the changelings have joined his Midnight Cult.

# Notable features
- Both knees are totally obliterated by an arrow. ([[Assless Chaps and Kneeless Caps]]) Sibela's legs are now useless from the thigh down.
