Abducted at birth by an #elf clan (see also: #changeling) who was loyal to the [[Iron Pact]]. 

Ivar later defected to the Ambrian army as a young boy during [[Attack of Eloan-Eo]]. Since then, Ivar has proved to be a valuable asset to the [[Queen's Rangers|Queenâ€™s Rangers]] and [[Twilight Friars|Black Cloaks]] by having insight into elf culture and tactics.

Has a weird eye. It grants him *shadow-sight*.
