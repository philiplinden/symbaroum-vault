Little is known of the rumored "Queen of [[Davokar]]" but none deny her commanding presence.

Aloéna is an *eternity* elf (the last stage of the elf life cycle, after *winter* elf), and as such is a giant she-being.

Aloéna resides in a grove on the cliff of [[Karvosti]].

>But where the humans had been intimidated into submission by his terrible wrath, the elven commander [[Eneáno]] sent for help. And help he would receive, in the form of the eternity elf, Aloéna.

>It was the ancient Aloéna who, through great cunning, mighty hymns, and brute force, single- handedly brought Garavarax down. Thanks to her, the elves could begin to sing the darkness back to sleep; thanks to her, they could plant the forest of [[Davokar]] and make its seeds strong enough to take root in the malignant dark, to bind it and fetter it to the ground. Garavarax was never slain – perhaps because he is truly immortal, or because Aloéna, for some reason, decided to spare his life. He was, however, plunged into a deep sleep, his colossal body lowered deep within the Mother Rock, to rest in her bosom, in the nocturnal currents of the Underworld. **Aloéna remained on the cliff to keep watch over the giant, ready to fight, should he ever break free from his slumber.**

>With the exception of Aloéna, [[Eneáno]], a few leaders of the [[Iron Pact]], and the residing Huldra, what is divulged in this chapter is **completely unknown by today’s cultural beings**. There are legends of giants, and an arbitrary tale claiming that [[Karvosti]] was once home to a monstrous creature called Arvarax, but present day barbarians regard these as nothing more than stories with little basis in reality.
