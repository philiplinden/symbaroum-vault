Former master of the [[Ordo Magica]]. His official duties were terminated due to his outspoken support of elves, but Vernam continues to tutor young wizards in [[Thistle Hold]] at [[Vernam's Academy|Vernamâ€™s Academy]].

Vernam invites some of his contacts to [[ðŸ“œ Find the Flayer]]

See [[@Copper2.MarkOfTheBeast|Mark of the Beast]], p. 7
> Master Vernam was allied to the [[Iron Pact]], one of very few among humans and unique among Ambrians: this was his true reason for stepping down from a position of power in [[Ordo Magica]]. To Vernam the fight against the corruption of Symbaroum comes first, and he could not serve the order wholeheartedly while at the same time fighting for the [[Iron Pact]]. He remained a member of [[Ordo Magica]], because of its vast knowledge but also because he hoped that he â€“ however unlikely â€“ would be able to convince more wizards that the struggle of the [[Iron Pact]] is righteous. Had he succeeded it would have meant a great victory in the battle against the Dark.
