Well known barbarian mystic of long ago. The true history of Aroaleta’s life is lost to the mythos and legends surrounding her identity. Many old barbarian proverbs are attributed to Aroaleta, but scholars speculate that her name is more of a *symbol* of “elders” from ancient [[Davokar]].

[[Witches of Melima]] worship Aroaleta directly, and [[Girind]] is likely a direct descendant.

Aroaleta is laid to rest in a sarcophagus in the [[Tunnels Beneath Lafarda's Tower|tunnels beneath Lafarda’s Tower]].
