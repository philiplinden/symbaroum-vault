# Three Forces of the World
"... and at the dawn of days was [[Wyrhta]], the power that creates. Where Nothing had reigned supreme, [[Wyrhta]] gave life to All; shaped here and there, spawned now and then,  
formed the one and in chorus the other.  
And where attraction arose,

Born of [[Wielda]]’s hunger for [[Wyrhta]]’s design, [[Wratha]] is everywhere and nowhere, always close where mother meets mother,  
always mounting in strength with the force of the violence.  
The arrival of the black fruit is fated,  
as inescapable as terrible ...  

... and it happens, has happened, will happen again,  
that [[Wratha]] grows boundless, furious, blind in her hunger.  
It happens that the blackness grows flesh and spirit and the sharpest of claws, that the fruit sheds seeds that poison the first,  
in the aim to suppress the second.
