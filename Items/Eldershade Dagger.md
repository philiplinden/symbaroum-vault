An ominous obsidian blade. In the light it appears faintly translucent with a deep reddish brown or rust tint.

The dagger was crafted by a [[Beast Clan]] fleshcrafting ritual that summoned a soul from the [[Yonderworld]] and trapped it in the blade.

The blade has the stats of a +2 dagger. 

**If the wielder has a soul, the following curse is applied**: Whenever the wielder fails a Wisdom saving throw, they have disadvantage on all saving throws until the blade is wetted with fresh blood. If the blade is already bloody, it requires blood from a new host to dispel the effect.

## Artifact powers
Cost of attunement: 1d8 corruption per use of power. +3 permanent to attune.

Attuning to it as an artifact reduces the curse to only cause disadvantage on Constitution saving throws, rather than all saving throws.

Attuning also allows the wielder to cut through stone, creating a wound that opens to the [[Yonderworld]]. The reverse can be done from the [[Yonderworld]]back to the natural plane.

Every time this power is used, the wielder must make a roll on the "Marks of Corruption" table and immediately suffer its effects.
