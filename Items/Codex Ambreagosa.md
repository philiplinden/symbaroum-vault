[[Erlaber Ambreagos]] described the Codex as
>A ~~tome~~ containing information on the Ambreagos family line going back centuries or millenia, tracing heritage to Symbarian nobility.

In fact the codex is a ~~tome~~ of forbidden ancient magic, written in the days of Symbaroum as a scientific effort to preserve life eternally through undeath.

The codex was eventually confiscated by a Symbarian noble, [[Na-Ethikel Ambreagos]], who used its power to assemble an undead army.

The codex describes ancient magics that [[Erlaber Ambreagos]] intends to use for foul means. See [[@Throne1.ThistleHoldWrath]].

The codex is believed to be a *book* or *tome*, but it is in fact a magical pearl imbued with the memories and emotions of the Ambreagos clan.

It is a pearlescent sphere like a cue-ball. Heavy. Smooth. Magnetic and electrically charged.

SHOCKS ONE TO THE TOUCH. Touch also has a chance to transfer emotions or memory/visions to the beholder.
